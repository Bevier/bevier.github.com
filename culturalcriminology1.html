<h3 id="theroleofculturalcriminology">The Role of Cultural Criminology</h3>

<p>In order to understand the role of cultural criminology as a subfield of criminology, it is necessary to first understand how cultural criminology sees itself, how it defines its own role in relation to the larger discipline. Jeff Ferrell, Keith Hayward and Jock Young conceptualize the subfield as a &#8220;sort of janitorial service&#8221; for academic criminology.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> This conceptualization and terminology originates from Mark Hamm&#8217;s description of his research on &#8220;social discards&#8221; (e.g., skinheads, terrorists, etc.).<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> Ferrell and co-authors extend the custodial metaphor well beyond the study of &#8220;discarded&#8221; groups and deviant subcultures, though. Just as Ferrell might be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/02/us-robinhood-odd-idUSTRE7B117420111202">literally</a> digging through your dumpster if you live in certain parts of Texas, he and his colleagues are combing through anything and everything that orthodox criminology throws out. </p>

<p></br> </p>

<p>In addition to conducting research on subjects and groups &#8220;other criminologists don&#8217;t much care to encounter,&#8221; cultural criminology also studies cultural artifacts discarded by dominant, &#8220;high&#8221; culture and/or defined as undeserving of serious scholarly analysis (e.g., graffiti walls, public memorials, state penitentiary graveyards, comic books and television programs, etc.). Cultural criminology not only acknowledges these excluded cultural artifacts as meaningful, it attempts to position them &#8220;at the heart of criminological inquiry.&#8221; <a href="#fn:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> </p>

<p></br></p>

<p>Choosing what &#8216;the mainstream&#8217; has discarded or ignored is more than simple sleight of hand or a form of reified resistance, opposition for its own sake. Cultural criminology &#8220;seeks to highlight the interaction between constructions upwards and constructions downwards,&#8221; <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a> and choosing to study that which has been discarded is an attempt to locate this interaction between containment and resistance. </p>

<p></br></p>

<p>In addition to salvaging outcast cultural artifacts and engaging deviant subcultures discarded by mainstream society, cultural criminology also makes use of the methodological approaches and techniques thrown out by mainstream academic criminology: ethnography, participant observation, and discourse analysis. Overall, the subfield of cultural criminology not only serves as a type of janitorial service, making use of what others define as rubbish. In practice as well as aesthetic appearance, it serves as a &#8220;trashy counterpoint&#8221; to the &#8220;neat execution&#8221; and &#8220;clean results&#8221; of orthodox criminology. <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> </p>

<p></br></p>

<p>Whereas this &#8220;sanitary&#8221; orthodoxy, this &#8220;aesthetic of academic precision,&#8221; is characterized by &#8220;finely ruled tables…precisely preset questions and answers, mailed to predetermined lists of respondents&#8221; toward the attainment of &#8220;certainty and assurance,&#8221; its trashy counterpoint is more interested in the &#8220;dirty ambiguities of daily transgression, the dangerous details of criminal acts&#8221; and &#8220;tends to reproduce in its results the messy uncertainty of people and their problems.&#8221; <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a></p>

<p></br></p>

<p>In this way, the role of cultural criminology as a subfield is similar to the role of radical art movements in early 20th century artistic landscape. It follows in the footsteps of earlier critical, culturally based criminologies that stood against orthodoxy in the 1960s, which Stan Cohen compares to &#8220;the products of radical art movements such as Dada and surrealism, anti-art created by artists.&#8221; <a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> </p>

<p></br></p>

<p>What these movements have in common is the will to challenge that which is taken most seriously within their respective fields. Relating this Dadaist critique to orthodox criminology, Ferrell states: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;[T]he more seriously a criminological method takes itself&#8211;the further it positions itself above other approaches through invocations of &#8216;objectivity&#8217; or &#8216;science&#8217;&#8211;the more that method is suspect of impeding understanding rather than advancing it.&#8221;<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, it is the core methods of criminology, those most established as given, that must be critiqued, challenged, even made fun of, most aggressively. </p>

<p></br></p>

<p>Given this healthy disrespect for the established wisdom of the discipline, the role of cultural criminology in relation to the larger field of criminology can also be conceptualized as a deviant subculture in itself, a pocket of resistance to the dominant culture of academic criminology. Indeed, many of the logics expressed in cultural criminology in regard to deviant subcultures are also expressed as characteristics of the subfield itself. </p>

<p></br></p>

<p>Some of the subfield&#8217;s earliest influences<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> conceptualized subcultural behaviors as attempts to solve collectively experienced problems or reconcile contradictions within a larger culture. A defining characteristic of cultural criminology is that it views the &#8220;larger culture&#8221; of orthodox criminology as in crisis, a contradiction in need of reconciliation; the first line of cultural criminology&#8217;s &#8220;manifesto for the twenty-first century&#8221; is &#8220;Mainstream criminology is an abject failure.&#8221;<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> </p>

<p></br></p>

<p>Cultural criminologists speak of taking &#8220;pleasure in moments of subversive resistance&#8221;<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> and of using methods and approaches they describe as &#8220;hectic, irreverent, transgressive, and, above all, fun&#8221;.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> When this subversive, transgressive academic approach is examined by the light of its own conceptualization of &#8220;transgression as a source of meaning,&#8221;<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> the subfield of cultural criminology appears as a subcultural site of resistance. From this space, newly formed constructions of meaning are negotiated and aimed upwards toward academia and agencies of control. </p>

<p></br></p>

<p>With the addition of this last conceptualization of cultural criminology as a deviant subculture that transgresses established norms of the culture of criminology, its function comes to form. As a subfield of criminology, cultural criminology serves the role of gadfly. Attached to the horse of academic criminology, it seeks &#8220;to reinvigorate the study of crime.&#8221;<a href="#fn:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> As Socrates&#8217; horse of Athens had grown &#8220;sluggish on account of [its] size&#8221; and needed to be &#8220;aroused by stinging,&#8221; it sees mainstream criminology as in a state of &#8220;stasis and decay.&#8221;<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> </p>

<p></br></p>

<p>Just as the gadfly&#8217;s role was to &#8220;go about arousing and urging and reproaching,&#8221; cultural criminology&#8217;s role is to &#8220;undermine those who claim authoritative knowledge of crime…[and] leverage up the very intellectual foundations of their work.&#8221;<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> Most essentially, as Socrates saw his role as the gadfly as a service and responsibility to his city, cultural criminology acknowledges the role we all play in the construction of the everyday reality of injustice and defines its &#8220;obligation&#8221; to build a criminology that can &#8220;define social life in other, more progressive terms.&#8221;<a href="#fn:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> </p>
