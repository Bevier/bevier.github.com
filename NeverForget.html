<p class="p3"><i><a id="doc273"></a>“This crusade—this war on terrorism—is going to take a while…”</i></p>

<p class="p3"><i>-George W. Bush, September 16, 2001</i></p>

<br> 

<p class="p6">It has been well over a decade since the illegal invasion of Afghanistan marked the inauguration of the U.S. Global War on Terror (GWOT). Over this course of time, the war has become firmly embedded within the American cultural psyche. It is referred to as the "forever war" (Klaidman 2012) or the "Orwellian war without end" (Rosenthal 2012). There is a “War on Terror” board game, in which the goal is to "liberate the world, ridding it of fear and terrorism forever (BoardGameGeek.com 2006). In <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i> it has now spawned a film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Existing in a state of war has become so ingrained within American culture that Jeh Charles Johnson, General Counsel for the U.S. Department of Defense, felt it necessary to remind us that "war must be regarded as a finite, extraordinary and unnatural state of affairs…"; he goes on to state, "[i]n its 12th year, we must not accept the current conflict, and all that it entails as the 'new normal'" (Wittes 2012).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4">Is it too late to call for such a rejection? What of the significant proportion of the U.S. population that began to formulate their political and national identities after September of 2001? For U.S. citizens old enough to vote for the first time in 2012, the war spans across the majority of their lives. In 2013, individuals that could not vote when this war began will turn thirty, having spent the entirety of their adult lives as citizens of a nation at war. Thus, there are many U.S. citizens who have little choice but to regard the Global War on Terror, and all that it entails as 'normal'. This normalization of the supposedly extraordinary begs the question: How has living in the shadow of war shaped post-9/11 U.S. national identity? This in turn motivates the central research question of my proposed research project: <b><i>How have America and the Global War on Terror been discursively constructed in U.S. Presidential Discourse since September 11, 2001?</i></b></p>
<p class="p4">Before endeavoring to answer this question, it is first necessary to understand this connection between U.S. national identity and discursive constructions of America, which calls for a brief explanation of the concept of 'discourse’ and its role in the construction of culture and identity. After this connection is elucidated, I will then turn to an explanation of the process of discourse analysis. Finally, I will apply the principles of this process to the key questions that guide and structure this research analysis.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</b></p>

<p class="p2"><br></p>

<p class="p5"><b><a id="doc206"></a>The Role of Cultural Criminology</b></p>

<p class="p6">In order to understand the role of cultural criminology as a subfield of criminology, it is necessary to first understand how cultural criminology sees itself, how it defines its own role in relation to the larger discipline. Jeff Ferrell, Keith Hayward and Jock Young conceptualize the subfield as a "sort of janitorial service" for academic criminology (2008:158). This conceptualization and terminology originates from Mark Hamm's (1998:111) description of his research on "social discards" (e.g., skinheads, terrorists, etc.). Ferrell and co-authors extend the custodial metaphor well beyond the study of "discarded" groups and deviant subcultures, though. Just as Ferrell might be literally digging through your dumpster if you live in certain parts of Texas, he and his colleagues are combing through anything and everything that orthodox criminology throws out.</p>
<p class="p7">In addition to conducting research on subjects and groups "other criminologists don't much care to encounter" (Ferrell et al. 2008:158), cultural criminology also studies cultural artifacts discarded by dominant, "high" culture and/or defined as undeserving of serious scholarly analysis (e.g., graffiti walls, public memorials, state penitentiary graveyards, comic books and television programs, etc.). Cultural criminology not only acknowledges these excluded cultural artifacts as meaningful, it attempts to position them "at the heart of criminological inquiry" (Ferrell et al. 2008:158). Choosing what 'the mainstream' has discarded or ignored is more than simple sleight of hand or a form reified resistance, opposition for its own sake. Cultural criminology "seeks to highlight the interaction between constructions upwards and constructions downwards" (Hayward &amp; Young 2004:259), and choosing to study that which has been discarded is an attempt to locate this interaction between containment and resistance.</p>
<p class="p7">In addition to salvaging outcast cultural artifacts and engaging deviant subcultures discarded by mainstream society, cultural criminology also makes use of the methodological approaches and techniques thrown out by academic criminology: ethnography, participant observation, and discourse analysis. Overall, the subfield of cultural criminology not only serves as a type of janitorial service, making use of what others define as rubbish. In practice as well as aesthetic appearance, it serves as a "trashy counterpoint" to the "neat execution" and "clean results" of orthodox criminology (Ferrell et al. 2008:159). Whereas this "sanitary" orthodoxy, this "aesthetic of academic precision," is characterized by "finely ruled tables…precisely preset questions and answers, mailed to predetermined lists of respondents" toward the attainment of "certainty and assurance," its trashy counterpoint is more interested in the "dirty ambiguities of daily transgression, the dangerous details of criminal acts" and "tends to reproduce in its results the messy uncertain of people and their problems" (Ferrell et al. 2008).</p>
<p class="p7">In this way, the role of cultural criminology as a subfield is similar to the role of radical art movements in early 20th century artistic landscape. It follows in the footsteps of earlier critical, culturally based criminologies that stood against orthodoxy in the 1960s, which Stan Cohen compares to "the products of radical art movements such as Dada and surrealism, anti-art created by artists" (1988:11). What these movements have in common is the will to challenge that which is taken most seriously within their respective fields. Relating this Dadaist critique to orthodox criminology, Ferrell (1996:191-2) states that "the more seriously a criminological method takes itself--the further it positions itself above other approaches through invocations of 'objectivity' or 'science'--the more that method is suspect of impeding understanding rather than advancing it." Thus, it is the core methods of the discipline, those established as given, that must be critiqued, challenged, even made fun of, most aggressively.</p>
<p class="p7">Given this healthy disrespect for the established wisdom of the discipline, the role of cultural criminology in relation to the larger field of criminology can also be conceptualized as a deviant subculture in itself, a pocket of resistance to the dominant culture of academic criminology. Indeed, many of the logics expressed in cultural criminology in regard to deviant subcultures are also expressed as characteristics of the subfield itself. Some of its earliest influences (Cohen 1955) conceptualized subcultural behaviors as attempts to solve collectively experienced problems or reconcile contradictions within a larger culture. A defining characteristic of cultural criminology is that it views the "larger culture" of orthodox criminology as in crisis, a contradiction in need of reconciliation; the first line of cultural criminology's "manifesto for the twenty-first century" (Ferrell et al. 2008:204) is "Mainstream criminology is an abject failure." They speak of taking "pleasure in moments of subversive resistance" (Ferrell et al. 2008:16) and of using methods and approaches they describe as "hectic, irreverent, transgressive, and, above all, fun" (Young 2002). When this subversive, transgressive academic approach is examined by the light of its own conceptualization of "transgression as a source of meaning" (Hayward &amp; Young 2008:261), the subfield of cultural criminology appears as a subcultural site of resistance. From this space, newly formed constructions of meaning are negotiated and aimed upwards toward academia and agencies of control.</p>
<p class="p7">With the addition of this last conceptualization of cultural criminology as a deviant subculture that transgresses established norms of the culture of criminology, its function comes to form. As a subfield of criminology, cultural criminology serves the role of gadfly. Attached to the horse of academic criminology, it seeks "to reinvigorate the study of crime" (Ferrell et al. 2008). As Socrates' horse of Athens had grown "sluggish on account of [its] size" and needed to be "aroused by stinging", it sees mainstream criminology as in a state of "stasis and decay" (Ferrell et al. 2008:161). Just as the gadfly's role was to "go about arousing and urging and reproaching," cultural criminology's role is to "undermine those who claim authoritative knowledge of crime…[and] leverage up the very intellectual foundations of their work" (Ferrell et al. 2008:196-8). Most essentially, as Socrates saw his role as the gadfly as a service and responsibility to his city, cultural criminology acknowledges the role we all play in the construction of the everyday reality of injustice and define it as their "obligation" to build a criminology that can "define social life in other, more progressive terms" (Ferrell et al. 2008:198).</p>
<p class="p5"><b><a id="doc241"></a>Conceptualizing Culture</b></p>
<p class="p6">"Culture" has been conceptualized throughout the history of social science in myriad conflicting iterations. It is thus helpful to briefly touch upon some meaningful patterns in the logic of these prior conceptualizations to better understand what 'culture' means to cultural criminology.</p>
<p class="p7">In <i>Culture as Praxis</i>, Zygmunt Bauman (1999: xvi-xvii) traces two distinct, diverging patterns of discourse in regard to the concept of culture. The first discourse, of which cultural criminology is an extension, conceptualizes culture as a kind of creative activity as well as the site of that creativity. Thus, it refers to culture as both a dynamic process as well as the symbolic space in which that process is carried out. It is the site of "invention, self-critique and self-transcendence" in which one can "step beyond closely-guarded boundaries." It is a space defined by the subversive freedom possible within it. Implicit within this conceptualization is the presence of multiple, possibly overlapping, cultures and subcultures. It aligns with the conceptualization of culture espoused within Albert Cohen's subcultural theory (1955), which marks this symbolic space as a site of resistance for "outsiders"--those groups of individuals viewed in a pejorative light by dominant cultural standards. In this formulation, a “dominant” cultural standard refers to those most widespread, and the transgression of prescribed boundaries is viewed as meaningful, creative action.</p>
<p class="p7">The second discourse, on the other hand, stands opposed to the first in a number of ways. Instead of conceptualizing cultural activity as a dynamic process, it is framed as a set of static practices. With a regularity to their patterned repetition, these cultural practices serve as "a tool of routinization and continuity--a handmaiden of social order." This conceptualization, more closely aligned with orthodox social anthropology and Parsonian functionalism, sees culture as kind of prop for social structure or a means to accomplish something akin to Durkheim's collective cohesion. Explicit within this conceptualization is the singularity of culture. There is no concept of resistance because there is no concept of dominant culture, only the value-laden notion of collective culture. Meaning is not actively constructed; it is held within this collective and is attained through successful socialization of the established cultural practices. In this formulation, the transgression of prescribed boundaries is neither meaningful nor creative; it is simply immoral. It marks the absence of culture, the result of failed socialization into the established collective meaning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">To see how cultural criminology relates to these two discourses, the work of Stuart Hall can be of service. Hall's work can be characterized by its emphasis on the uneven relations of cultural power--"the power to decide what belongs and what does not" (1974:452) His formulation of culture as a dynamic process is built around a dialectic of cultural struggle. This struggle is poised between two ever-present poles of influence: control and resistance. Applying this logic to Bauman's cultural discourses, cultural criminology positions the two at opposing ends of a dialectic of cultural struggle. The first represents a cultural discourse of resistance, a willingness to risk envisioning and enacting collective alternatives to the latter, which represents the cultural discourse of control--"the notion of culture as existing somehow outside human agency…the collective belief in tradition, the emotional embracing of stasis and conformity, the ideological mobilization of rigid stereotype and fundamental value" (Ferrell et al. 2008:4).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">The conceptualization of culture in cultural criminology maintains much of the first discourse outlined by Bauman. It is a dynamic concept intimately tied to the collective human construction of meaning. It is used to refer to the active process of constructing meaning as well as the symbolic space in which these meanings are constructed. Thus, cultural criminology reformulates and extends culture not just as the site of creative activity but also as the site of creative constructions of meaning. Culture is even used as synonymous with meaning itself, as Ferrell and co-authors refer to cultural criminology's "twin focus on culture and crime--put differently, on meaning and transgression" (2008:4). This statement not only equates culture directly with meaning. By designating this as cultural criminology's "twin focus," the authors refer to the interplay between the two, or the process through which meaning is collectively (re)constructed as its boundaries are transgressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">As transgression itself is conceptualized as a source of meaning (Hayward &amp; Young 2004), examining it in relation to culture is a way to get directly at this live process always and already taking place. This negotiation of meaning not only elucidates the processes through which humans creatively construct their social world. This intersection of meaning and transgression, of culture and crime, is of particular interest to cultural criminology in that it is the space in which constructions downwards (control) and constructions upwards (resistance) collide. Whereas both crime and crime control are each cultural products (i.e., creative human constructs), their meanings are constantly generated and regenerated around these interactions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Reflecting the logic of Hall's dialectic of cultural struggle, cultural criminology not only conceptualizes culture as a site of resistance and subversive freedom but also as the site of control and repression of difference; it is a site of struggle. The continuous construction of meaning within the dialectic of cultural struggle creates an ongoing tension between (1) cultural maintenance (moral entrepreneurship), (2) cultural disorder (transgression), and (3) cultural regeneration (moral innovation). This is the conceptualization of culture as arena: the symbolic space in which constructed meanings compete for the power of legitimacy. This formulation implies that, through the lens of cultural criminology, even the meanings we construct around the concept of 'culture' are cultural products. It is an ongoing, cultural process with a long-standing tradition through which the meaning of the term 'culture' is negotiated. If that negotiation is ever finalized, if every last person agrees and assigns the same meaning to the term, it will still be a human creation and thus, a cultural product.</p>
<p class="p7">In addition to conceptualizations of culture as creative process and sites of struggle, cultural criminology's formulation can also be characterized as a semiotic. Keith Hayward and Jock Young quote symbolic anthropologist Clifford Geertz:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="bq">The concept of culture I expose…is essentially a semiotic one. Believing with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be these webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretative one in search of meaning. (1973:5)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">There are several important points within Geertz's quote. First, he states that culture and its webs of significance are human constructions, and he then places emphasis on the assignment of significance and meaning. Both points, down to the selection of metaphorical imagery, are reflected in cultural criminology's conceptualizations of cultural relationships— “those webs of meaning and perception in which all parties are entangled” (Ferrell 1999:398)—and cultural forces—the “threads of collective meaning that wind in and around the everyday troubles of social actors” (Ferrell et al. 2008). It is also relevant that he refers to his concept of culture as semiotic, as the closest thing to a direct operationalization of culture in the literature is "the symbolic environment occupied by individuals and groups" (Ferrell et al. 2008:2).</p>
<p class="p7">Lastly, Geertz's aligning himself with Weber is of interest on multiple levels. First, it speaks to the aforementioned, ongoing process through which the meaning of 'culture' is negotiated. Most likely due to differences in translation, it is difficult to position Weber's conceptualization of culture. Whereas some position culture at the forefront of his method (Ringer 1997), for other Weberian scholars it is so inconsequential to appear in the index only as "culture, meaninglessness of" (Kalberg 2007). Even in these works, however, if one follows the lead of cultural criminology and equates 'culture' with the construction of meaning, the role assigned to "subjective meaning" in Weber's work becomes the "culture" of cultural criminology.</p>
<p class="p5"><b><a id="doc242"></a>Theoretical Lineage</b></p>
<p class="p6">The theoretical roots of cultural criminology are longstanding and widespread. As a theoretical framework, it continues to build on the foundations of sociological thought encompassed within the works of Marx, Weber and Durkheim while also incorporating modern developments in fields of postmodernism, feminism, symbolic interactionism and social constructionism. Its particular theoretical lineage within the study of crime and deviance can be traced back to the "cultural turn" made by new deviance theorists in the 1950s and 1960s, through the emergence of late modernity and concurrent "turn towards deconstruction" in the 1970s, and into the "British synthesis" of phenomenology, subcultural theory and labeling theory made at the New Deviance Conference, the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and the London School of Economics.</p>

<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc245"></a>New Deviance Theory</i></p>

<p class="p6">The direct theoretical lineage of cultural criminology, the starting point of "the gathering storm" (Ferrell et al. 2008), springs from the emergence of new deviance theory. This theoretical development is conceptualized as containing two strands: subcultural theory and labeling theory. Developing alongside one another and often in debate, the two schools of thought "shared in common a distinctly cultural approach to the explanation of crime and deviance" (Ferrell et al. 2008:26).</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc246"></a>S<span class="s1">UBCULTURAL</span> <span class="s1">THEORY</span></p>
<p class="p6">The first work marked as a gathering cloud is Albert Cohen's classic subcultural work Delinquent Boys: The Culture of the Gang (1955). Emblematic of the logical shift in subcultural theory, Cohen borrowed from the conceptualization of culture developed in social and cultural anthropology, which saw subcultural behaviors as responses to collectively experienced problems--attempts to reconcile contradictions within the larger culture. The key theoretical point that separates this line of logic from prior subcultural theories is that, in addition to accounting for the transmission of subcultural values through socialization, "mature subcultural theory" (Ferrell et al. 2008:34) also addresses the origins of these differentiated cultural values.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p7">The most essential insight within this context is that the behavior of deviant subcultures, rather than a hollow, mechanical response to external stimuli or merely a symptom of cultural deficit, is understood as meaningful action. Because its meaning is defined by the particular social time, place and context in which it is created and embedded, the subjective experiences of subcultural members became important areas of inquiry. Flowing from this logic is the insight that most delinquent behavior is not strictly utilitarian; rather than a simple means for desired material goods out of one's perceived reach, most delinquency is transgressive at its core. Growing up in the face of a cultural milieu defined by specific (middle) class values coupled with structural impediments to their attainment for some (lower-class) individuals can create the feeling of status deprivation. A possible attempt to ameliorate this feeling is to reject and replace, or invert, the unattained values by which one is judged. As new meaning is constructed, this becomes a process of cultural work. As this process becomes a collective endeavor, a subculture is created.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc247"></a>L<span class="s1">ABELING</span> <span class="s1">THEORY</span></p>
<p class="p6">The second strand of the new deviancy school came from labeling theory. Drawing from social constructionism (Berger &amp; Luckmann 1966) and radical phenomenological traditions, labeling theorists eschewed the positivist attempt to reflect the objective reality of deviance on the basis that no such objectivity exists. Deviance is not an already-existing type of action or behavior waiting to be uncovered by the scientific method, nor is it defined by any intrinsic characteristic. Deviance is a social construction. It is culturally contingent. It is the dynamic product of an ongoing collective process of human creation and is definitively subjective.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">A critical element within the labeling theory framework is the addition of the W.I. Thomas theorem: "If men [and women] define their situations as real, they are real in their consequences." Thus, although definitions of crime and deviance are social constructed and inherently subjective, the meanings created through this cultural work have very real, objective consequences. Important also is the acknowledgment that the social processes of constructing meaning around the labels of crime and deviance are not of a democratic nature. Constructions do not carry equal weight within the cultural arena. As the specters of political authority, legal sanction and socialized stigma loom large, "the labeling process is one of power and marginalization" (Ferrell et al. 2008).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">A principle of labeling theory crucial in the logic and development of cultural criminology is the relationship between crime / deviant behavior and social control. Rather than the strictly linear, unidirectional relationship previously presumed within positivist thought (i.e., crime/deviance exists, social control reduces these behaviors), labeling theorists acknowledged the subjectivity and nuanced complexity of this relationship, and in so doing, turned this orthodox relationship on its head. This shift in logic makes a basic principle of English common law: <i>nullum crimen sine legs</i>, <i>null poena sine legs</i> (no crime without law, no punishment without law) relevant again in two slightly different yet connected ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">First, labeling theory acknowledges the aforementioned subjective nature of crime. The concept of crime is created through the outlawing of specific behaviors by a legal authority. Without the law to label a behavior as criminal, there can be no such thing as crime. Thus, logically speaking, social control in the form of criminal law and legal sanction creates crime by labeling an already existing behavior as criminal. The second and much more dangerous idea is of a less abstract nature: When criminal / deviant labels are put upon an individual, he or she can internalize the label as part of his or her identity and thereafter act in accordance. Thus, social control creates crime not just as a new classification of an already existing behavior; in this way control creates behavior that would not have taken place otherwise through the creation of secondary deviance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">The cultural turns of these two theoretical strands, subcultural and labeling theories, constituted the emergence of the new deviance theory, the direct theoretical antecedent to cultural criminology. The next step in this progression is the synthesis of the two approaches. As Stan Cohen came to explain, "[a]fter the 1960s--well before Foucault made these subjects intellectually respectable and along way from the Left Bank--our little corner of the human sciences was seized by a deconstructionist impulse" (1997:101). This movement in the sociology of deviance, "cultural in its focus and post modernist in its sensibility" (Hayward &amp; Young 2004), germinated at the London School of Economics.</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc248"></a>The British Synthesis</i></p>
<p class="p6">Beginning with David Downes' (1966) book "The Delinquent Solution" and further developed by London School of Economics PhD students Jock Young (1971) and Stan Cohen (1972), what has been referred to as "the British synthesis" (Ferrell et al. 2008) came to fruition at the National Deviancy Conference of 1968 and within the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies. Hayward and Young set as a defining characteristic of cultural criminology that it "seeks to highlight the interaction between constructions upwards and constructions downwards" (2004:259). The exploration of this interaction was a key development of the British synthesis.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">As labeling theory addressed the constructions of meaning flowing downward from those with power and legal authority onto the marginalized / criminalized, subcultural perspectives address the (re)constructions of meaning flowing upward from marginalized subcultures. When these two strands are synthesized toward the understanding of the interplay and interaction between constructions upwards and downwards, a crucial concept within cultural criminology comes to the fore: processes of mediation. By studying the complex relationships between the interpersonal worlds of deviant subcultures, social control interventions by the powerful and constructions of each within mass media, the "new criminologists" (Taylor, Walton &amp; Young 1973) and cultural analysts (Hall &amp; Jefferson 1976; Hebdige 1979; Willis 1977) began to explore the processes of mediation reflected in Ferrell's vast "hall of mirrors" (1999).</p>
<p class="p8">Thus, the theoretical foundation of cultural criminology is built from the perspectives emerging from British "new criminology" and the Birmingham school of cultural studies (Ferrell 1999:396). From the new criminology, it borrows and builds on an emphasis of the relationships between crime, representation and social control (Cohen &amp; Young 1973; Chibnall 1977). From cultural studies, it borrows and builds on the exploration of the situated dynamics of deviant / criminal subcultures (Hebdige 1979;1988) and the importance of symbols and style in the construction of meaning and shaping of identity (Willis 1977;1990). From their integration, it borrows and builds on the analysis of mass media's role in constructing the reality of crime and generating new forms of social and legal control (Hall et al. 1978; Cohen 1972;1980).</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc249"></a>A Hybrid Orientation</i></p>
<p class="p6">As a "hybrid orientation" (Ferrell 1999:397), though, the constitution of cultural criminology is built on more than this "simple integration" of British cultural studies / new criminology; it continues to develop and be influenced by insights in a number of fields. Indeed, Ferrell frames it as “…less a definitive paradigm than an emergent array of perspectives linked by sensitivities to image, meaning, and representation in the study of crime and control” (1999:396). Among this array of perspectives, cultural criminology draws from recent developments in (1) postmodernism, (2) interactionist sociology / symbolic interactionism, and (3) constructionist sociology.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc250"></a>P<span class="s1">OSTMODERNISM</span></p>
<p class="p6">Cultural criminology reflects a number of ideas seen within the postmodern intellectual orientation. It rejects the dualistic mode of thought characteristic of modernist theorizing, in particular the duality and formal separation of form and content. Whereas a modernist orientation would position the two in a hierarchical relationship, conceptualizing form as the inconsequential surface that must be pried away in order to access truly meaningful essence of content, "cultural criminology operates from the postmodern proposition that form is content, that style is substance, that meaning thus resides in presentation and re-presentation" (Ferrell 1999:397). This is the logical extension of earlier cultural turns within the study of crime and deviance that rejected positivist notions of an objective reality waiting to be uncovered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">As actions cannot be boiled down to their individual "deviant" essences, neither can an idea be separated from the way in which it is presented. As content is presented in different forms, the meaning assigned to it can change. This can happen any number of times and in any number of directions, which is why cultural criminology focuses not just on images, but on "images of images." “[M]edia messages and cultural traces swirl, circulate, and vacillate" (Ferrell et al. 2008:124). Within “networks of connections,” meaning is constructed through an ongoing feedback process (Baudrillard 1985:127). These are the mediated networks Manning (1998) calls "media loops" that circulate and recirculate images, narratives and constructed meanings. They speak to the discursive interconnections emerging between criminal subcultures, agents of crime control and mass media (Kane 1998). This all takes place within the cultural arena, the "infinite hall of mirrors" (Ferrell 1999), out of which the reality of crime and crime control are constructed.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc251"></a>S<span class="s1">YMBOLIC</span> <span class="s1">INTERACTIONISM</span></p>
<p class="p6">Cultural criminology also reflects principles developed within symbolic interactionism and the interactionist traditions in the sociology of deviance and criminology. The theoretical framework of symbolic interactionism (Mead 1931; Blumer 1969) is logically consistent and connected to developments in cultural criminology. One can easily see, for example, the feelings and experience of status and/or relative deprivation through the lens of Charles Horton Cooley's concept of the looking glass self, which outlines an individual's "self-idea" as constituted by "three principle elements: the imagination of our appearance to to the other person; the imagination of his [or her] judgment of that appearance, and some sort of self-feeling, such as pride or mortification" (1902:152).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Though symbolic interactionism is easily connected to its foundation, cultural criminology draw more directly from later interactionist traditions within the sociology of deviance and criminology (Becker 1963; Pfuhl 1986). In particular, it borrows and builds upon the emphasis on the examination of social interactions through which meaning is constructed. It highlights the symbolic nature of interaction and the emergence of symbolic universes with their own codes of action and behavior. Specifically applying these principles and concepts to the study of crime and deviance, cultural criminologists examine the symbolism contained within mediated crime imagery. They analyze deviant subcultures as symbolic universes in which crime takes on political meaning as a form of resistance. On the macro-level, they examine the interactions through which criminals, agents of control and media producers collectively construct the meaning of crime.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc252"></a>C<span class="s1">ONSTRUCTIONIST</span> <span class="s1">SOCIOLOGY</span></p>
<p class="p6">Cultural criminology also reflects and furthers developments within recent constructionist sociology literature (Best 1995; Loseke 2003). The principle conceptualization shared, also a key facet of earlier working in labeling theory, is of crime and crime control as social and political constructions. One can easily link key constructionist concepts to parallel logics in cultural criminology. The "social problems game" of competing "claims-makers" (Loseke 2003) vying to convince audience members of the rightness of their cause plays out within the cultural arena, its outcome driven by cultural power--"the power to decide what belongs and what does not" (Hall 1974:452). In this way, "social problems work" (Loseke 2003:52) is cultural work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Whereas both cultural criminology and constructionist sociology attempt to disentangle the mediated processes of social construction through which meaning is created, cultural criminology adds further nuance to this unraveling by extending their gaze beyond traditional "mass" media. In addition to exploring mediated constructions of meaning beyond mass media (e.g., ethnographically in subcultures of resistance and contextually in television, film and literature), cultural criminology also brings a "spiraling postmodern sensibility" in its analysis. In doing so, it moves beyond simple dualistic conceptualizations of crime / coverage and truth / distortion seen at times within constructionist media analysis (Ferrell &amp; Websdale 1999).</p>
<p class="p5"><b><a id="doc243"></a>Methodological Influences</b></p>
<p class="p6">Cultural criminology is informed by multiple methodological approaches developed in, out, and even against the discipline of criminology. Within criminology, Ferrell, Hayward &amp; Young (2008:161) trace the beginnings of a cultural approach to methodology back to the same ground they mark "many of contemporary criminology's foundational works" as emerging from: the Chicago School. Particularly relevant for cultural criminology is the Chicago School's emphasis on engaged research practices. Current scholarship in the field harks back to the ethnographic orientations and "idiosyncratic, impressionistic approaches" of scholars such as Nels Anderson (1923), who explored the lives of the Chicago homeless, and Frederic Thrasher, who documented "the thrilling street life of the gang" (1927:79) and even included his own photographs of gang rituals and life in the Chicago "ganglands." It is from this point moving forward that the methodological lineages of cultural criminology and of "mainstream article" (Feagin et al. 1991) or "orthodox" (Ferrell et al. 2008:159) criminology begin to diverge.</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc253"></a>Against Orthodoxy</i></p>
<p class="p6">As the influence of the Chicago School waned, the practice of engaged, participatory research suffered a similar fate. Stepping into this void was a standardized style of survey research that "has held sway within the discipline ever since" (Adler &amp; Adler 1998: xiii). Standards of random sampling and objective detachment from the subject(s) under study, among others, were adopted in order to position the discipline as an objective science (Ferrell et al. 2008). It is against this established orthodoxy that the methodological approaches of cultural criminology truly began to crystallize.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">Many of the theoretical influences of cultural criminology previously mentioned also carried the torch of participatory, engaged research methodology. Subcultural and labeling theory scholars (Becker 1963; Polsky 1967) contributed vastly influential participatory ethnographies in addition to the "equally unorthodox methods of engaged research" (Ferrell et al. 2008) employed by British new deviance theorists (Young 1971; Cohen 1972). Such research is emblematic of criminological thought's "Abstract Expressionism" period that followed as a reaction against the 1950s positivist "Renaissance" (Adler &amp; Adler 1998: xiii-xiv). Springing from this period are two significant works instrumental to the development of cultural criminology: Feyerabend's Against Method (1975) and Cohen's Against Criminology (1988).</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc254"></a>A<span class="s1">GAINST</span> <span class="s1">METHOD</span></p>
<p class="p6">In <i>Against Method</i>, Feyerabend traces the development of science's great methodological innovations. Rather than isolated discoveries devoid of human subjectivity, he outlines how such developments are historically and culturally situated. These major innovations, even the scientific method itself, are cultural products. Their widespread acceptance and implementation was accomplished through appeals to the subjective, as ascendence in the cultural arena is contingent on hearts and minds. Whereas these major methodological shifts appear as the inevitable outcomes of pure, linear scientific progress, this appearance is itself a product of a mediated vantage point. That is, if one believes the path to social progress is marked by the scientific method, any outcome attributed to the scientific method is defined as progress. This circular logic is the method Feyerabend stands against.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc255"></a>A<span class="s1">GAINST</span> <span class="s1">CRIMINOLOGY</span></p>
<p class="p6">In <i>Against Criminology</i>, Cohen calls for the establishment of immanent critique, a constant questioning of orthodox research practices, assumptions and modes of thought. He works through the influence and importance of the "Abstract Expressionist" intellectual upheaval against orthodox criminology of the 1960s and 1970s, of which he was a part. Putting this principle into practice, however, he goes on to make a case for the importance of rising up against the very movement of which he was an integral part. He is "intellectually unwilling to toe the line, even one he helped draw" (Ferrell et al. 2008: 160). Thus, the criminology that Cohen stands against is any iteration of the discipline that holds still. As truth is contingent and the world dynamic, any method or technique established as complete must be called into question. Intellectual strength springs from intellectual movement, and the closest thing to an essential method, tool or technique of criminological inquiry is 'lack of commitment to any master plan' (1988: 109).</p>
<p class="p7">It is the combination of these two works that serve as the dynamic ground upon which a cultural methodology can be built. "Taken together Feyerabend and Cohen suggest a sort of anarchist understanding of method and knowledge" (Ferrell et al. 2008). Thus, it is less a concrete foundation than a cultivated plot of land, cleared of extraneous debris. It is this space in which Feyerabend's methodological principle can be actualized: "The only principle that does not inhibit progress is: <i>anything goes</i>" (1975:23; emphasis in original). Without being restricted by the commitment to orthodoxy, cultural criminology is free to heed Becker's call to "look at all the people involved in any episode of alleged deviance…all the parties to a situation, and their relationships" (1963:183, 199; quoted in Ferrell 1999: 398).</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc256"></a>True to Subject</i></p>
<p class="p6">A background of methodological anarchy, however, does not mean that there is no rhyme or reason within the methodological framework of cultural criminology. As orthodox principles of methodology are deconstructed, new principles and practices, more open and adaptable to the shifting landscape of a dynamic reality, must be constructed in their stead. These constructions are guided by the logic of David Matza's concept of "naturalism" (1969). Methodological decisions are thus driven by the necessity of researching the social world on its own terms, being "faithful to the phenomenon under scrutiny" (Ferrell et al. 2008) and "true to subject--without either romanticism or the generation of pathology" (Hayward &amp; Young 2004:268). In the case of human behavior, these terms include an emphasis on subjectivity, emotion, and the mediated construction of meaning. For cultural criminology, this emphasis is accomplished through the "attentive gaze" (Hayward &amp; Young 2004) and "ethnographic sensibility" (Ferrell et al. 2008) of a criminological <i>verstehen</i> (Ferrell &amp; Hamm 1998) and is informed by various developments across sociology, anthropology and cultural studies. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">The concept of criminological <i>verstehen</i> is rooted first and foremost in the work of one of sociology's founding fathers: Max Weber. His original concept of <i>verstehen</i> called for social scientists to develop a kind of sympathetic subjectivity, an empathetic understanding of the emotional context in which social behavior takes place. Thus, a criminological <i>verstehen</i> positions cultural criminology as an inherently personal endeavor through which researchers reflexively engage with the situations and subjects under study; it denotes a "subjective appreciation and empathetic understanding of crime's situated meanings, symbolism, and emotions" (Ferrell 1999:400). This positioning reflects and is informed by long-standing traditions in criminology (Becker 1963) and the sociology of deviance (Humphreys 1975) on deep inquiry into the situated dynamics of deviant subcultures (Ferrell 1999).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">The methodology of cultural criminology also reflects and is informed by developments in the field of anthropology. In addition to hallmarks of the discipline such as the use of thick description and attentiveness to the power of narrative, symbolic anthropologist Clifford Geertz's work was paramount in the development of cultural criminology, in particular his method of "understanding social action in terms of the deep reading of culture" (Hayward &amp; Young 2004:260). As Geertz's work attests, the rejuvenation of Weberian logic was not limited to the "cultural turns" of 1960s criminology and/or sociology of deviance. Influenced by Weber's concept of <i>verstehen</i>, Geertz also saw subjective engagement as necessary in the development of an interpretive understanding of human behavior. This subjective involvement also means that the individual researcher must be reflexive enough to acknowledge and account for the role played by his or her own cultural baggage, situated assumptions, and preconceived notions within the research process. Researchers must understand the role they themselves play within the construction of meaning, thus providing a kind of "ethnography of ethnography" (Van Maanen 1995b).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">Cultural criminology is in many ways defined by a sensitivity to situated values and nuances of meanings. This attentiveness to the subtle particulars of cultural milieux reflects and is informed by traditions in cultural studies. As cultural criminology is driven by the desire to be "true to subject," developments in cultural studies helped to inform the conceptualization of that subject. From Stuart Hall, John Clarke, and other scholars of the Birmingham School, cultural criminology comes to define representational dynamics, symbolic discourses and stylistic ambiguities as fundamental in describing the cultural worlds from which they spring. The influence of cultural studies is also reflected in cultural criminology's ethnographic orientation, as Paul Willis stated that his ethnographic approach was "dictated by the nature of [his] interest in 'the cultural'" (1977:3). Another important aspect of cultural criminology is its attention to visual forms of communication. This attention to image also reflects the Birmingham school tradition, which drew from the work of documentary photographers, image makers and others to develop a "grammar" for decoding cultural symbols (Jefferson 1976; Hebdige 1979).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">Thus, cultural criminology brings together disciplinary distinct but logically related research principles and practices to form a cultural methodology suited for the late modern world. In addition to the deeply influential works in criminology (Cohen 1988; Matza 1969) and philosophy of science (Feyerabend 1975) that cleared the way for its construction, this methodological approach is built with (1) sociology's principle and practice of <i>verstehen</i> (Weber [1920] 1978), (2) anthropology's emphasis on thick description and practice of understanding social action through a deep reading of cultural narratives (Geertz 1973), cultural studies' attentiveness to precise nuances of meaning, representational dynamics and symbolic discourses (Willis 1977; Hall et al. 1978). By meshing these principles and practices together with is own postmodern spin, cultural criminology builds its own "multi-layered ethnographic approach" (Hayward &amp; Young 2004).</p>
<p class="p5"><b><a id="doc244"></a>Limitations and Future Prospects</b></p>
<p class="p6">The field of cultural criminology has been conceptualized as "less a definitive paradigm than an emergent array of perspectives" (Ferrell 1999: 396). This lack of cohesion across the field is one of the multiple limiting factors existing at the core of the perspective. Several of these limitations, though, were built into the perspective's foundation with purpose. Rather than mere oversight, these limitations represent a calculated trade-off determined by the unorthodox aspirations of those involved. In many cases, the logic guiding these decisions can be found within the perspective's theoretical landscape. The lack of cohesion across the field, for instance, is not a result of schisms organized around fundamental disagreements in the field's founding principles. It is the result of the decision to leave the field "open and invitational" (Ferrell et al. 2008) for continued theoretical and methodological engagement. The logic of this decision is easily traced: "methodological neatness and intellectual closure suggest stasis and decay…methods not fully conceptualized or completed, suggest intellectual life and disciplinary vitality" (Ferrell et al. 2008:161).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Highlighting the acknowledged purpose and theoretical backing of this decision, however, is not meant to gloss over its potentially limiting aspects. Whereas the field's open borders invite outside engagement and leave room for disciplinary growth, they also leave space for disciplinary ambiguity. As these ambiguities relate to method, they are more easily overcome for multiple reasons. It is easy enough to access a number of methodological texts of approaches widely used within cultural criminology (ethnography/field work, ethnographic content analysis, discourse analysis, etc.), as the recent methodological developments that inform the field are explicitly stated (see Ferrell 1999:399).</p>
<p class="p7">The theoretical ambiguities within the field, however, are not as easily overcome. The main limitation of this theoretical ambiguity manifests within the definition of culture. It has been noted, "the way that different cultural criminologists deal with this issue validates Ferrell's claim that cultural criminology is a perspective" (Webber 2007:154). This, again, is not likely an oversight, as the Ferrell, Hayward &amp; Young consistently refer to principles of "fruitful disorderliness" and "theoretical anarchism" (Feyerabend 1975: 118-21). Although the broad and open conceptualization of culture has not proven to be inherently problematic, there has been such a litany of academic attention paid to defining "culture," especially in its relation to structure/agency, that it has become a loaded word that some can't move past (see O'Brien 2005).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Another built-in limitation of cultural criminology is its lack of fit within a statistical model. Though, given the generalized disdain expressed toward methods of statistical abstraction, sampling procedures and preset question banks designed "to divorce from the research process the human particulars of both researches and those they study" (Ferrell et al. 2008:162), it is safe to say this is closer to a point of pride than an oversight by the authors. Though hard to find, there are brief moments in which the utility of anything quantitative is acknowledged, as "a useful tool for suggesting patterns of presentation" (Ferrell et al. 2008: 188) for instance. For the most part, though, cultural criminology does not lend itself to quantifiable measurement or direct causal analysis. Even with access to massive, longitudinal datasets, cultural criminology's rejection of linear sequences of causation and emphasis on situated nuances of meaning are simply not designed for direct measurement and theory testing. The most significant limitation that results from this incompatibility with quantitative analysis is in terms of dollars and cents. As Craig Webber stated in reference to the prospective growth of cultural criminology, "with the 'smart' money being on the type of research that 'counts' human behavior, such a body of work is unlikely to be forthcoming soon" (2007: 139).</p>

<p class="p1"><b><a id="doc209"></a>CHAPTER III</b></p>
<p class="p1"><b>LITERATURE REVIEW</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><b><a id="doc282"></a>Discourses of America</b></p>
<p class="p6">If we understand ‘discourse’, what, then, is ‘American discourse’? The first point to explain is the use of the term ‘American’ as a shorthand representation for the United States of America. The problematic aspects of this rhetorical replacement have been noted (Beirne and Messerschmidt 2010), as ‘America’ more accurately refers to the whole of North and South America, which includes the US and <i>thirty-four</i> other sovereign nations. This rhetorical overrepresentation is precisely why I choose to use the term; it is itself emblematic of “American discourse” in that it positions the US as the focal point of the free world, a beacon whose light outshines and overshadows other nations. This conceptualization of the US is relevant to American discourse in that it is a particular idea, a particular way of knowing the US that is drawn upon to construct meaning and therefore direct action. It is among the interconnected ideas and particular knowledges that constitute the field of American discourse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">When viewed through the lens of discursive analysis, use of this seemingly simple rhetorical shorthand is shown to be much more complex. Like the tip of an iceberg, it is the surface-level signifier of something that exists at a much deeper level. One of the definitive questions of discourse analysis is of underlying, unspoken assumptions. In this context, referring to the US as ‘America’ expresses an underlying assumption of superiority and suggests that other nations in North and South America are of relatively little consequence. This idea, that the US is a uniquely superior nation and/or the ‘leader of the free world’, is part of the established American discourse. Thus, referring to the US as America, as a manifest expression of this idea of superiority, is a statement of American discourse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">The preceding formulation is the expression of but one of the many interconnected ideas that are drawn upon to define the US. Others commonly used include the beliefs that the US is the home of equal opportunity and free enterprise, the defender of freedom and democracy across the world, and the site of global innovation and moral leadership, to name a few. The connection these statements share that makes them particularly theoretically relevant is that they conceptualize the US as a whole in <i>relation</i> to the world at large and thus, implicitly or explicitly, define the nation’s role in global affairs. A particular framework through which the US has been commonly defined in such relation is through the idea of <i>American exceptionalism.</i></p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc283"></a>American Exceptionalism</i></p>
<p class="p6">The idea of American exceptionalism has framed and guided the course of world history with juggernaut force. The America that exists discursively as the “beacon of freedom and hope” set to shine upon an otherwise-unenlightened world, the America that exists empirically as a creative exporter of explosive armaments, and the fantasy by which we are compelled to conceptualize two such ideas as interdependent, could not exist without the idea of American exceptionalism. Its meaning is multi-faceted, and its definitions and functions are contingent upon the angle of approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">For some, the term simply means that America is historically <i>unique</i>; the gulf of galvanized difference between America and other nations of similar standing, whether it be a matter of degree or of categorical distinction, occupies a larger scope of difference than that existing between any other nations of similar standing. This conceptualization of the nation and its history is built on two central arguments: (1) The United States is qualitatively different from other democratic societies in that it was formed as a democratic society with no official prehistory, established aristocracy, or past feudal system; (2) The U.S is quantitatively differentiated by the relatively lower amount, in sheer number as well as political influence, of major socialist parties in its history. These arguments imply that American society is a unique phenomenon within the world-system of nations and its history, and it should be regarded and studied as such.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></p>
<p class="p8">The second facet of the American exceptionalism discourse is that the term exceptional not only denotes a nation with a unique formation and culture; it implies that the United States is <i>uniquely superior</i> to other nations. The foundation of this premise is built on the purported role that America plays as the assumed moral leader of nations as well as the massive economic role the nation plays within the modern world-system, which includes the enormous amount of influence the American financial system plays within the global financial market as well as the sheer amount of economic growth experienced in post World War II society. Most essential to this argument of assumed superiority, though, are the ideals upon which the nation stands: freedom, liberty, and democracy, all of which are assumed to be actualized in the civic and political landscape of the United States.</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc294"></a>State Fantasy</i></p>
<p class="p6">Within <i>The New American Exceptionalism</i>, Donald Pease formulates the role of fantasy in political discourse and examines the influence of identifiable ideologies within both the macro-maintenance of modern society and the micro-construction of meaning and individual identity formation. The fantasy framework is easily connected to both macro and micro processes because it fulfills essential functions for both the state as well as the individual citizen. For the individual citizen, state fantasy provides an ordered and coherent narrative that provides a meaningful connection to one’s social environment. Seemingly fractured and chaotic events must be brought into some form of order to be rendered meaningful. Within this framework, it is state fantasy, or “the dominant structure of desire out of which U.S. citizens imagine their national identity,” that renders individual citizen's political lives meaningful and brings “the chaos of political events into order” (Pease 2009:4). For the political and economic elite, state fantasy, if successful, convinces the citizenry to desire the social order that already exists, therefore maintaining certain positions of privilege and influence without their appropriateness coming into question.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">The fantasy of American exceptionalism is accomplished by constructing a political discourse that frames the United States as: (1) a nation of superior moral and economic ideals, and (2) the self-appointed defender of those ideals across the globe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="bq">American exceptionalism defined America as having already achieved the condition of the ideal nation that normally incited national desire. After it defined America as the fulfillment of the world's dream of an ideal nation, the fantasy of American exceptionalism eradicated the difference between the national ideal US citizens wanted and the faulty nation they had, by representing America as having already achieved all that a nation could be. American exceptionalism thereafter motivated US citizens to displace their normal national desire—to achieve an ideal nation—with the abnormal desire to propagate the US model of nationalism.” (Pease 2009:22)</p>

<p class="p6">The particular formulations and basic tenets of this ideology of American exceptionalism change according to each newly exposed contradiction they are purposefully constructed to hide. What the fantasy cannot hide, it must incorporate into its internal logic, reformulating it to fit comfortably within the carefully and coherently constructed narrative. In order for the state to maintain its perceived legitimacy, manifest contradictions must be defined as necessary by the logic of state fantasy. By constructing the terrains of the perceptible, state fantasy works as ideology in Adorno’s “strict sense” of the term—as “a necessary illusion” that “automatically encourages and tolerates only such knowledge of itself that slides off its back without any impact” (1976[1969]:86). Thus, when the state transgresses its own ideals, individual citizens who are ontologically invested in their national identities must either question the previously-held meaning they associated with their country or submit to the circular logic by which U.S. transgressions are automatically redefined as necessary because of nation’s status as the Nation of Nations, the City on the Hill, the moral leader of the free world. Such a fallacy of logic is able to exist because of the very desire held by citizens to view their lives as meaningful, which becomes stronger than any notion of truth when measured against the possibility of being confronted with a chaotic politic void of coherent meaning.</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc302"></a>Homeland</i></p>
<p class="p6">The present formulation of the state fantasy of American exceptionalism was inaugurated in the wake of September 11, 2001. The attacks on the World Trade Center could not be understood within the logic of any previously formulated U.S narrative. Such traumatic events, especially one of such unseen atrocity, of course, cannot be ignored by state fantasy. Given that “a nation is not only a piece of land but a narrative about the people’s relation to the land” (Pease 2009:166), such trauma entails more than the physical experience of pain; it also refers to the emotional and psychological trauma that coincides with the loss of ontological security provided by state fantasy. This trauma, the instantaneous loss of the national narrative that “brought the chaos of political events into order” (2009:4) instilled a feeling of displacement within the citizenry. Instead of attempting to hide the collective crisis of U.S national identity in the face of such profound uncertainty and ontological insecurity, the state incorporated these national feelings of displacement as the foundation of its new mythical state narrative, which “successfully takes hold when it transposes theses sites of trauma into the inaugural spaces within a newly configured order” (Pease 2009:5).</p>
<p class="p8">The specific state fantasy shattered on that September morning was the conceptual metaphor through which the U.S. was imagined as “Virgin Land,” which entailed US citizens’ “collective wish to disavow the historical fact of the U.S. forcible dispossession of indigenous peoples from their homelands” (Pease 2009:155). This state fantasy remained the nation’s originating narrative as taking place within an unpopulated space, a blank slate upon which the nation’s manifest destiny was to be written. Accompanying this myth, as George W. Bush stated just days after 9/11, was the idea that “Americans have known wars, but for the past 136 years they have been wars on foreign soil.” Within this conceptual framework, the absence of an attack on U.S. soil was not only associated with proof of American <i>strength</i>, it also served as proof of America’s <i>radical innocence</i>. Thus, the trauma inflicted on that September morning was two-fold, including both the newly-existing trauma of the actual event as well as the newly-exposed trauma discursively veiled by state fantasy. This new trauma represents innocence lost; U.S. citizens no longer had proof of their nation’s moral high ground, its <i>exceptionalism.</i> This loss of the Virgin Land’s inviolability obliged the construction of a new narrative, a state fantasy of American exceptionalism that could explain the nation’s sudden collective disembeddedness as well as provide a direction to proceed in order to overcome such feelings and regain faith in its innocence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>If America’s moral standing and radical innocence were previously evidenced by the absence of attacks on its soil, Bush reclaimed such evidence by framing the attacks of 9/11 as categorically different from all hitherto known, defining them as “unlike any other we have ever seen.” It was not an attack on a nation or its peoples; it was “our way of life” that came under attack: “They hate our freedoms…These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way of life.” Further distancing the attacks from the state, Bush stated that:</p>
<p class="bq">This is not, however, just America’s fight, and what is at stake is not just America’s freedom. This is the world’s fight. This is civilization’s fight. This is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">This was not an attack on America; it was an attack on the civilized world, on ideals, on freedom. That it was directed at America specifically only showcases the nation’s status as the world’s “beacon of freedom.” After being reimagined through the lens of state fantasy, an attack on American soil, instead of calling its innocence into question, actually strengthens the nation’s moral claim to innocence. The U.S. was attacked not because of any morally suspect behavior; it was attacked because it represents the <i>actualization of morality</i>. Whereas an absence of attacks previously provided proof of American innocence, the opposite now evidences the same.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">The lasting significance of the myth of American exceptionalism, through, requires more than the maintenance of American innocence. Not only must the nation be constructed as an ideal; it must also defend its ideals across the globe if it is to maintain its status as <i>an exception to its own rules.</i> Thus, from the nation’s reclaimed moral high ground, Bush sets out to enact the wrath of American innocence upon those defined as deserving. Living in a space to which they could no longer understand their relation, U.S. citizens acquiesced in George W. Bush’s newly forged state fantasy, which propagated the belief that the collective disembeddedness of the nation could only be overcome by absolute victory in the Global War on Terror—“whatever it takes” (Bush 2004a). Such victory is discursively constructed as the exclusive path toward the attainment of both physical as well as ontological security. It is a war between “freedom and fear, justice and cruelty,” (Bush 2001b) in which “civilization is taking a decisive stand against terror and chaos” (Bush 2004b) and “our responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil” (Bush 2001a). Within this logic, the transgression of U.S. ideals is held irrelevant by the idea that, without absolute victory, there will be no ideals left to transgress.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">Thus, any transgression of U.S ideals, if defined as necessary within the War on Terror, is remained as an expression of the same ideals it contradicts, reflecting Pease’s assertion that “state fantasies regulate the symbolic order by organizing U.S. citizens’ relationships to its inherent rifts and contradictions as if they were sources of personal enjoyment rather than pain or resentment” (2009:6). Through state fantasy, then, contradictions are remained as necessary, transgressions are experienced as corroborations, and unity of American identity and purpose is perceived as axiomatic.</p>
<p class="p5"><b><a id="doc207"></a>State Crime</b></p>
<p class="p6">When asking a question of whether certain areas of inquiry are critical to the future of a field, it is important to establish the criteria by which the field will be judged. For the field of criminology, the simplest answer is that it will be judged by its ability to shed light upon the reality of crime. Of course, this answer brings with it another question: What is crime? If we again go with the simplest answer, we would say that crime is an act that violates criminal law. Thus, to understand crime, we must understand criminal law. But where does this criminal law come from? Who designates a behavior as criminal? How are such decisions made? By whose authority are they upheld?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">To address these as well as many other questions essential to the field of criminology, the state cannot be ignored. If we are to acknowledge that the law is not an actualization of divine will or a perfect reflection of a universal division between good and evil, then we acknowledge that law, and thus crime, are products of human construction. In order to shed light upon the reality of crime, it is thus essential to examine this process by which some acts (and not others) are defined as criminal. This, the criminalization process, is an intrinsic part of a criminology of the state and critical to the past, present, and future of the field of criminology.</p>
<p class="p9">If we are to hold to the same broad criterion of shedding light upon the reality of crime, how can turning to state crime as a focal point in criminology be justified as critical to the future of the field? Whereas the criminalization process is implicated across the spectrum of criminological inquiry, state crime is but one ‘type’ of crime. Turning to any one particular area of inquiry implies turning away from others. How can such a decision be justified as one that will shed more light on the reality of crime? There are at least two arguments for such a shift in focus: (1) the area in question has been relatively neglected as an area of criminological inquiry, and (2) the phenomena in question have relatively larger social consequences and/or affect a greater number of people.</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc259"></a>Relative Neglect</i></p>
<p class="p6">The first argument: Turning to state crime as a focal point in criminology will highlight areas of inquiry that have been relatively neglected by the discipline. William Chambliss, in the opening statement of his 1988 ASC Presidential Address, made such an argument for “state-organized crime,” which he refers to as “a form of crime that has heretofore escaped criminological inquiry, yet its persistence and omnipresence raise theoretical and methodological issues crucial to the development of criminology…” (1989:183). Chambliss built on previous arguments that had similarly addressed the lack of attention given to crimes committed by governments (Douglas and Johnson 1977), especially those involving genocide (Brown 1971; Horowitz 1977) or victimizing nations referred to as ‘Third World’ (Shawcross 1979). Chambliss’s Presidential Address “provided the more direct and immediate inspiration” (Rothe and Friedrichs 2006:149) for proceeding studies in state crime exploring areas and themes similar to those earlier identified as neglected, such as the lack of attention given to crimes perpetrated by states against their own citizens (Barak 1990), genocide and the social production of immorality (Jamieson 1999), as well as an expanded victimology of state crime (Kauzlarich, Matthews, and Miller 2001).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">An increasing amount of academic attention has been paid to some transnational ‘non-conventional’ forms of crime (e.g., terrorism, organized crime, corporate crime), but, despite the documented calls for scholarly attention, “governmental crime—or crime carried out in a government context—[continues to receive] significantly less attention” (Rothe and Friedrichs 2006:147), as most criminologists worldwide continue to focus on conventional forms of crime, conventional crime control efforts, and criminal justice system responses to traditional street crime. The relative neglect of state crime as an area of criminological inquiry is acknowledged by a number of scholars. In their reevaluation of the field, several leading scholars of state criminality note that “the study of state crime still has a long way to go before it ever reaches the magnitude or legitimacy afforded to the study of traditional street crime” (Rothe et al. 2009:4). Hagan and Rymond-Richmond ask, “Why is criminology—the science of crime—so slow to study the ‘crime of crimes’?” (2009:xx). A possible answer to this question is provided by Kramer (2009), who claims that criminologists have generally failed to subject the legal and moral violations of state officials to the same level of critical scrutiny reserved for other forms of criminal behavior, citing the discipline’s dependence on formal legalism, its primary focus on private crimes, as well as its prosystemic character in general as factors that have worked to limit academic attention to state crimes.</p>
<p class="p8">Rothe and Ross (2008) document the neglect of state crime as a subject area in introductory criminology textbooks. The authors provide both qualitative and quantitative evidence that shows how these introductory textbooks “have disproportionately ignored the subject matter of state crime” (p. 741). Perhaps the most damning evidence documenting the neglect of state crime, though, is provided by two separate studies of major U.S. and British journals of criminology and criminal justice. Both Michalowski and Kramer (2006) as well as Tombs and Whyte (2003) found that articles focused on crimes of the powerful (i.e., state and corporate crimes) represented less than three percent of total articles.</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc260"></a>Scope of Social Consequence</i></p>
<p class="p6">The second argument for turning to state crime as a focal point in criminology is that not all crimes are created equal; to truly understand the reality of crime, crimes that have relatively larger effects and/or affect a greater number of people should garner more academic attention. Do these arguments apply in the case of state crime? If we operationalize the concept in terms of Chambliss’ definition—“acts defined by law as criminal and committed by state officials in the pursuit of their job as representative of the state” (1989:184) with the author’s later addition of “behavior that violates international agreements and principles established in the courts and treaties of international bodies” (1995:9)—different instances of state crime, both domestic and international, affect a vast number of people and/or have dire, irreversible consequences for those affected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">The scope of state crime’s consequence is documented in decades of scholarly research. In terms of affecting a large number of people, the CIA has illegally gathered intelligence on over one million US citizens (Parenti 1983:170–1; Rockefeller Report 1975:101–15), which pales in comparison to the reports of more recent acts of illegal intelligence gathering made through the US PRISM program (Braun et al. 2013). In terms of having larger/more serious consequences, Frappier (1984) documents an overwhelming amount of international law violations made by US state officials through the illegal intervention in the internal affairs of dozens of sovereign nations. Such interventions have obvious (and not-so obvious) political ramifications, the true strength and scope of which are impossible to measure (see Green and Ward 2009). This is to say nothing of the numerous documented instances of state-organized assassinations and murders (Dinges and Landau 1982; Gasiorowski and Byrne 2004; Lernoux 1984:188).</p>
<p class="p8">Contemporary scholars of state criminality often conceptualize the scope of state crimes’ social consequences in relation to that of other crimes. Rothe states: “State crimes are historically and contemporarily ever-present with atrocious results leading to more injury and death than all traditional street crimes put together” (2009:xvii); Friedrichs refers to state crimes as “the worst crimes—in terms of physical harm to human beings, abuse of civil liberties, and economic loss” (2007:122). Thus conceptualized, the expansive scope and dire character of state criminality’s social consequences is directly related to scholarly acknowledgment and analysis of war crimes (Hagan and Greer 2002; Kramer and Michalowski 2005; Rothe 2009) and acts of genocide carried out by state actors (Cohen 2013; Hagan and Rymond-Richmond 2009; Savelsberg and King 2011). Rothe (2009) documents the massive costs of such state crimes through different forms of harm, including environmental (e.g., nuclear waste cleanup), physical (e.g., millions of deaths at the hands of state regimes), psychological (e.g., widespread cases of PTSD), financial (e.g., over $30 billion for reconstruction efforts in Iraq), as well as cultural, social, and/or political dimensions (e.g., decreased legitimacy of cultural, political, and social systems).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8">Rothe (2009) limits her discussion of the costs of state crime to state actions formally defined as criminal by legalistic standard (i.e., those resulting from states’ violations of domestic and/or international laws). Whereas this delineated formulation includes the tens of millions of lives lost to genocidal state actions, for those working with “a more expansive definition of state criminality, the costs and harms are even more insurmountable” (p. 76). Examples of more expansive definitions include those informed by human rights restrictions (McEvoy 2007; Schwendinger and Schwendinger 1970), socially analogous harm/analogous social injury (Michalowski 1985, 2007), social audience/citizen perception (Green and Ward 2000) as well as process-driven approaches that focus on historical struggles to criminalize particular state practices rather than breaches of specific normative criteria (Lasslett 2014).</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc261"></a>Conceptualizing the State</i></p>
<p class="p6">The state has been conceptualized in myriad, contradictory ways throughout the history of classical and contemporary criminology. It has been cast as both a criminogenic problem as well as the solution to the problem of crime. Depending on the theoretical perspective employed, the state can be seen as the main source of crime prevention, a criminal actor, a criminogenic institution, and/or a contrivance for the criminalization of those perceived as a threat to the status quo. The two most diametrically opposed conceptualization of the state can be traced back to the origins of criminological thought, the first of which is represented by classical criminology.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc262"></a>C<span class="s1">LASSICAL</span> C<span class="s1">RIMINOLOGY</span></p>
<p class="p6">The conceptualization of the state and its resultant role in classical criminology springs from its assumptions pertaining to human nature. The idea from which all others emanate is that it is ‘natural’ for individuals to pursue their own narrow self-interests at the expense of others. Left unchecked, this pattern of behavior culminates in what Thomas Hobbes referred to as “the war of all against all” and is reflected in Beccaria’s foundational notion that “every man (sic) tends to make himself the center of his whole world” (1764:11). Classical criminology not only assumes this to be the case, it assumes that at some point there became a consensus that this was the case. This consensus sparked individuals to realize that it was in their mutual self-interest to guard against this “despotic spirit” (1764:13). Classical criminology is thus predicated on the assumption of a consensus throughout society specifically pertaining to the desirability of protecting private property and personal welfare. It is in the name of this protection that individuals freely enter into a “social contract” with the state. The idea is that citizens of a society sacrifice to the state a small portion of their own personal liberty in the name of personal and material security. The aggregate of these individual slices of personal liberty constitutes the “right to punish” yielded by the state (1764:13). Thus, classical criminology paints the “despotic spirit” (1764:13) of humankind as the problem and the state as the collective solution, a neutral tool to be used for the common good.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc263"></a>E<span class="s1">ARLY</span> R<span class="s1">ADICAL</span> C<span class="s1">RIMINOLOGY</span></p>
<p class="p6">Beccaria and Bentham’s models of classical criminology were not the only theoretical writings on crime of their time. A vastly different picture of crime, the social contract, and the state was painted by radical writers of the enlightenment era. In his analysis of varieties of enlightenment criminology (Classical and Early Radical), Jenkins (1984:114) writes:</p>
<p class="bq">Enlightenment criminology was almost as broad a spectrum as that of the twentieth century. To see Classical views alone as representing the side of reform would be like seeing the Californian treatment model of the 1950s as the sold trend in twentieth-century penology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">The term ‘radical criminology’ is most often used to describe applications of Marxist theory to the study of crime and crime control. Whereas the writings referred to here as early radical criminology, specifically those of William Godwin (1793) and Marquis de Sade (1787, 1797) are not explicitly Marxist, they do share a common materialist philosophical orientation and similarly offer only revolutionary solutions to crime that advocate for the abolishment of private property.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">At the heart of the distinction between classical and early radical criminologies are two wholly opposing conceptualizations of the state, in particular as it relates to the establishment of the social contract. For classical theorists, humanity is inherently wicked. The only way to guard against society plunging into its “original chaos” (Beccaria 1764:13) is the establishment of effective social controls, which is accomplished through the social contract and enforced by the state. For early radical theorists, this causality is inverted. It was the establishment of the social contract that marked the true beginning of injustice. Whereas classical theorists conceptualize the social contract as a solution to the problems of an inherently flawed humanity, early radicals saw this imposition of social order as the problem, in that it created a flawed social system through which the few had power over the many. It was unjustly established to protect a social and economic system based on private property and maintain material inequality. By creating poverty, it created crime. The doctrine of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“original chaos” was the lie that those in power told to justify their own sins over those without property.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">For both of these enlightenment criminologies, the state’s ultimate reason for existence is to enforce the social contract and therefore protect the political system of private property. The key difference is that classical criminology assumes that this social contract is based on and accurately reflects a consensus of values within society, whereas early radical criminology see this as a consensus of values within one (property-owning) segment of society. Classical criminology’s solution is early radical criminology’s problem. In early radical criminology, the state is thus conceptualized as: a criminogenic force, as it creates and perpetuates inequality; a conduit of criminalization, as it criminalizes “offenses which the wealthier part of the community have no temptation to commit” (Godwin 1793:631); as well as a criminal actor, as it unjustly punishes those without property.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc264"></a>C<span class="s1">ONTEMPORARY</span> C<span class="s1">RIMINOLOGY</span></p>
<p class="p6">The opposing conceptualizations of the state expressed in classical and early radical theories of crime, which can be broadly referred to as conceptualizations rooted in consensus and conflict theoretical orientations, respectively, continue to exist in contemporary theories of crime and deviance.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"><a id="doc265"></a>Consensus theories</span><span class="s3">.</span> There are a number of contemporary theories of crime and deviance that are defined on some level by an assumed consensus of values throughout society. The particular value-consensus such theories presuppose is one based on the core principles of a consumer-based, capitalist economy and thus predicated on private-property based socio-economic organization of society. Hagan refers to such consensus-based theories as “structural functionalist theories,” those in which “[w]ide agreement or consensus is assumed…about the core socioeconomic values of society—about what people want from their lives and how they are expected to behave in achieving theses goals” (2012:70).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">An example of a consensus-based theory is provided by Merton’s formulation of anomie theory (1938). The value consensus that structures Merton’s theory is in regard to culturally defined success goals, with particular emphasis on: (1) the high social value placed upon the individual achievement of monetary success, as well as (2) the widespread belief in the American Dream, or equal opportunity to access the legitimate means for attaining monetary success. Merton, assuming a consensus in both realms, focuses on the strain toward criminal behavior produced by structural barriers that block access to these legitimate means, impeding the realization of the American Dream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">Another example of a consensus-based theory can be found in delinquent subcultural theories such as Cohen’s (1955), which assumes a consensus of values based on the “middle class measuring rod.” Cohen posited that the experiences and resources available to many working-class youth do not adequately prepare them to fulfill the social and educational expectations of the middle class measuring rod. Such early failures bring about feelings of “status frustration” in working-class youth, which pushes many to reject the consensual values of middle-class society and adopt their inverted form. Delinquent subcultural values (e.g., “non-utilitarian, malicious, and negativistic”) are thus diametrically opposed to the value-consensus of society’s non-criminal elements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">An example of a contemporary conceptualization of the state that is rooted in an assumed consensus is Hirschi’s (1969) theory of social control. Much like the classical conceptualization of humanity, Hirschi begins with the assumption that most people have ‘antisocial’ tendencies, which will be actualized in the absence of effective social controls. These social controls work by bonding an individual to society through: (1) attachment to parents, school, and peers; (2) commitment to conventional lines of action; (3) involvement in conventional activities; and (4) belief in conventional values. Hirschi not only assumes that a consensus exists as to the definition of ‘conventional’ lines of action, activities, and values. He positions state actors (teachers and police officers) and state values (respect for the law and police officers) as representations of this consensus. The state, with its ‘conventional’ values, is thus conceptualized as the solution to criminal, antisocial behavior.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"><a id="doc266"></a>Conflict theories</span><span class="s3">.</span> The multi-faceted, conflict-oriented conceptualization of the state put forth by early radical theorists gains even more nuance in its more contemporary formulations. Several of the different facets of the original radical formulation spurred their own theoretical lineages. The conceptualization of the state as a weapon of those in power, wielded through the criminalization of certain behaviors (and not others) can be seen in conflict criminology (Quinney 1970) and the labeling perspective (Becker 1963). The conceptualization of the state as a criminogenic force can be seen in a number of contemporary theories as well. Building on the early radical critique of a political-economic system of private property, contemporary radical/Marxist criminology holds that, whether it causes crime through promoting egoism at the expense of altruism (Bonger 1905) or through the creation of ‘problem populations’ expressing the fundamental contradictions of the capitalist economy and social control institutions (Spitzer 1975), the (capitalist) state is <i>the </i>criminogenic force to be reckoned with.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p9">The conceptualization of the state as a criminal actor can be seen in contemporary critical criminology, which has shed light upon state political repression (Parenti 1983) and state-corporate crime (Kramer, Michalowski, and Kauzlarich 2002) as well as provided criminological analysis of the invasion and occupation of Iraq (Kramer and Michalowski 2005).</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc267"></a>Understanding the Place of the State</i></p>
<p class="p6">The place of the state in the study of crime and criminology is best understood through the theoretical perspectives broadly referred to as conflict criminology and critical criminology as well as through an emergent body of work on state criminality.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc268"></a>C<span class="s1">ONFLICT</span> C<span class="s1">RIMINOLOGY</span></p>
<p class="p6">A true understanding of a criminal act begins with an understanding of the process through which said act came to be defined as criminal. This process cannot be analyzed without addressing the state, as the process of criminalization does not exist without it. The theoretical perspective of conflict criminology aids in the understanding of this process by first acknowledging that it is indeed a process in which the state is involved. Thorsten Sellin recognized that crime data was based on legalistic definitions of behavior dictated by the state and argued against the “unqualified acceptance of the legal definitions of the basic units or elements of criminological inquiry…[especially when] assumed to be universal” (1938:23). Arguing against universal definitions based on an assumption of consensus is a key component of conflict theory. In the stead of consensus and universally accepted definitions, conflict theorists see fundamental conflicts between different value systems and struggles for power between interest groups. The state represents one of many such interest groups. The acknowledgement of a plurality of perspectives emanating from distinct value systems helps the researcher to understand the place of the state by forcing the acknowledgment that one’s own perspective of the state is just that, a perspective. It is but one existing among many.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">This logic of competitive interest is the same that drives Vold’s (1958) group conflict theory, which views the processes of criminalization, criminal behavior, and crime control as representative of deep-seated conflicts driven by the perpetual tension between competing interest groups. Vold points to the fact that changes in political power structure also bring changes in the discursive labeling and social status of those involved, noting that “a successful revolution makes criminals out of the government official previously in power, and an unsuccessful revolution makes its leaders into traitors” (p. 214).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">This is an understanding of the place of the state in the study of crime and criminology informed by conflict perspective, specifically the first proposition of Richard Quinney’s phenomenologically-informed conflict theory of crime: “<i>Crime is a definition of human conduct that is created by authorized agents in a politically organized society</i>” (1970:14-5, emphasis in original).<i> </i>The state stands in the space directly behind the crime itself. If one merely examines the crime at face value, one only sees the crime, which must be observed from multiple angles to see the state behind it. If interpretation remains solely focused on the surface-level observation, only one facet is observed. The criminal act appears two-dimensional, a simple manifestation of an easily explained desire. After taking a different approach, one can see that the initial observation was merely the image the state was holding out, the one it wanted us to see, the one it sees. As the act is examined from even more angles, it appears to be more complex but also more familiar. With additional perspective, something three-dimensional begins to come into focus. The act becomes harder to label but easier to understand.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc269"></a>C<span class="s1">RITICAL</span> C<span class="s1">RIMINOLOGY</span></p>
<p class="p6">Critical criminology is a label applied to multifarious theoretical endeavors in the study of crime and criminology. Numerous scholars have attempted to outline its central tenets and subfields (Schwartz and Milovanovic 1996) and distinguish it from other criminological traditions, radical criminology in particular (Lynch 1996). Radical criminology has previously been referred to here as applications of Marxist theory to the study of crime and crime control, particular those of the late 1960s and 1970s (Chambliss 1975; Platt 1974; Spitzer 1975; Taylor, Walton, and Young 1973). DeKeseredy (1996) holds the same timelines but extends this definition. He outlines two defining features of radical criminology: (1) rejection of state definitions in favor of class-based definitions of crime, and (2) focus on crimes of the powerful. Critical criminology began to take shape in the mid 1980s, when the focus of radical criminologists broadened to include postmodern perspectives (Milovanovic 1994, 1996), feminist perspectives (Daly and Chesney-Lind 1988), and left realism (Young 1987). Lynch (1996) makes a similar distinction, defining radical criminology as a radical approach to economics grounded in Marxist theory and critical criminology as an integration of more diverse theoretical approaches.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Theories under the banner of critical criminology might be defined less by the principles and propositions they share than by the ones they reject. It is from these common rejections, outlined by MacLean and Milovanovic (1998), that a theoretical perspective able to aptly address the place of the state in the study of crime and criminology can be constructed. Among these common themes of non-critical criminological perspectives rejected by critical criminologists are: purely legalistic definition of crime; the lack of attention paid to political economy and overwhelming inequalities; the targeting of selected groups by law enforcement agencies and officials; and the disguising of systematic practices of sexism, racism, classism, and their intersecting effects as neutral realities. Whether it is in defining crime, creating criminogenic social forces, or performing illegal, discriminatory acts in the name of crime control, the common tie that binds these rejected themes together is the (lack of) acknowledgement of the role of the state. This defining feature of critical criminology helps us to best understand the place of the state in the study of crime and criminology: the state is ever-present—as a criminogenic force, as a conduit for criminalization, and/or as a criminal—and it must be acknowledged as such.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc270"></a>S<span class="s1">TATE</span> C<span class="s1">RIMINALITY</span></p>
<p class="p6">There is a burgeoning body of literature built on the acknowledgement and analysis of the state as a criminal actor. This literature helps us to understand the place of the state in the study of crime and criminology by addressing state crime’s contradiction of criminal definition problem, which poses the question: What is the place of the state in defining state crime? If the state is the authority that defines its own actions as criminal, will any state criminalize its own behavior? The contradiction of criminal definition problem represents academic criminology’s initial resistance to the idea of a criminally liable state; its common argument was that “governments and their agencies do not commit crimes, but only because criminal law does not take cognizance of them as criminal actors.” Thus, the state can only commit “noncriminal deviance” (Cohen 1990:104). Similarly, Sharkansky (1995) argued that the only way a state action could be labeled as criminal would be if said action explicitly violated the state’s own laws. Any other criteria in the author’s conceptualization would violate principles of national sovereignty. Even state actions widely recognized by the international community as criminal are “nasty” but not criminal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Other scholars of state criminality, however, were guided by a contrasting conceptualization of the place of the state in defining its own actions. This conceptualization was informed by the conflict-oriented position that relying solely on the state’s legalistic definitions of crime results in a loss of scientific autonomy by the social scientist (Sellin 1938). It was also informed by the critical/humanist-oriented position that strict reliance on the state’s definitions of crime omits socially injurious acts (Michalowski 1985) and other restrictions of human rights (Schwendinger and Schwendinger 1970). Such critiques resulted in the expansion of the state definition into a “social definition” of state crime. What I refer to as a “social definition” of crime is any definition that moves beyond an exclusive reliance on the state’s definition of its own behavior. Thus, the distinction is not between “legal” and “social” definitions of state crime; a definition of state crime that relies on international legal codes still falls under the banner of a “social” definition. The main distinction: Whereas a state definition relies on the state’s ability and willingness to criminalize itself, a social definition recognizes the legitimacy of other authorities. Such authority can be official (e.g., codified by an international legal body) or unofficial (e.g., notions of human rights; socially analogous harm; citizen/public opinion). In short, a social definition recognizes that the state does not have a monopoly on the right to define behavior.</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc271"></a>Reconceptualizing Crime</i></p>
<p class="p6">A criminology of the state asks us to reconceptualize crime, law, and punishment in crucial ways. It asks us to travel back to the origins of criminological thought and reanalyze the formation of the state in order to develop a deeper understanding of its connection to the creation of law, the definition of crime, and the justification of punishment. A criminology of the state would ask us to account for the influence of the state and its connections to the power of propertied classes in the history of the field of criminology itself. Rather than conceptualizing classical criminology as the inevitable product of enlightenment-era reform, it would highlight the state interests served by accepting classical reforms as legitimate over the more radical proposals of the same era. In revisiting the creation of law and enlightenment-era legal reforms, a criminology of the state would highlight the fact that the legal system created was not an inevitable outcome in the progression of the history of the liberal state. It was one an outcome embroiled in conflict and won by those with property.</p>
<p class="p8">A criminology of the state would ask us to reconceptualize crime in at least two important ways. It would first acknowledge the role of the state in defining certain acts (and not others) as criminal. It would ask what state interests particular laws served. It would apply the state’s own logic of criminal definitions to state actions, highlighting inconsistencies and contradictions. It would show that the line between crime and convention is thinner than the state would have us believe, and it would ask us to analyze the state’s efforts toward further separating the two in the minds of its citizens. It would ask us to analyze the state’s various practices designed to increase its appearance of legitimacy and maintain its monopoly on the use of coercive force. It would ask us to reconceptualize the state’s practices of punishment. It would ask us to examine the state’s ideological interests in controlling certain ‘problem’ segments of the population and material interests in maintaining the prison-industrial complex. It would ask us: What is the purpose of punishment? It would ask us to revisit <i>Of Crimes and Punishments</i>, but it would not be referring to the work of Beccaria but rather its response of the same name by William Godwin (1793), who argued that the use of punishment or coercion in any form only appealed to the very lowest portion of human nature. No matter how morally sound the intention, he argued that its result was nothing more than alienation of the subject, thus finding no justification for punishment, not as retribution, as incapacitation, as deterrent, or as rehabilitation. It only has the potential to force compliance in its simplest form; its only message is to blindly "submit to force, and abjure reason. Be not directed by the convictions of your understanding, buy by the basest part of your nature, the fear of personal pain, and a compulsory awe of the injustice of others" (Godwin 1793:644). A criminology of the state would ask us to prove him wrong.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>RESEARCH METHODS</b></p>

<p class="p3"><i>- Michael Foucault (1972:31)</i></p>

<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc274"></a>What is Discourse?</i></p>

<p class="p6">I use 'discourse' to refer to patterns of interconnected ideas and particular knowledges that are drawn upon to construct meaning. I use 'discursive statements' to refer to statements or groups of statements that are themselves the manifest expressions of particular ideas and knowledges, i.e., discourses. When in a group of statements, "one can define a regularity (an order, correlations, positions and functioning's, transformations), we will say, for the sake of convenience, that we are dealing with a <i>discursive formation</i>” (Foucault 1972:38; emphasis in original). Thus, within American <i>discourse</i>, I will examine <i>discursive statements</i> in an effort to identify patterns of constructed meaning that coalesce to form <i>discursive formations</i>.</p>
<p class="p9">In its most broad sense, this conceptualization of 'discourse' fits within the logic of Rosalind Gill's formulation of the term as a potential reference to any and "all forms of talk and texts" (1996:141). More specifically, though, it corresponds to what Gillian Rose (2007:146) refers to as "discourse analysis I", as it is concerned with the <i>articulation</i> of discourse and "how people use language to construct their accounts of the social world" (Tonkiss 1998:248); what is most essential to this conceptualization is the <i>constitutive</i> <i>power</i> of discourse.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc275"></a>T<span class="s1">HE</span> P<span class="s1">OWER</span> <span class="s1">OF</span> D<span class="s1">ISCOURSE</span></p>
<p class="p6">The power of discourse springs from its productive capacity. When articulated, discourse produces what it describes. As individuals construct meaningful accounts of their social world, those constructions, defined as real, become real in their consequences; that which is articulated is actually called into being. As ideas are acted upon, discourses not only discipline individual subjects into particular modes of thought and paths of action. It is through the productive power of discourse that human subjects are created. We socially construct our identities as we express and interact with ideas and constructions of meaning.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc276"></a>D<span class="s1">ISCOURSE</span> <span class="s1">AND</span> I<span class="s1">DENTITY</span></p>
<p class="p6">The discursive process through which one's subjective self is created is not a simple, unidirectional imposition of identity from a discourse over and above human agency. It is complex and open to constant construction and reconstruction. As a process, it can be analytically divided into <i>active construction</i> and <i>interactive reconstruction</i>. As we use language to construct accounts of our social world, we are using discourse to actively construct our identities. Thus, active construction refers to the external expression of discursive statements; such expressions are primarily intended to persuade an audience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Whereas the articulation of discourse through language is meaningful for the speaker's own active construction of identity, equally important is the productive capacity of discourse for those who encounter these articulations. As others use language to construct accounts of their social worlds, audience members “decode” (Hall 1974) the statements they encounter, interpreting them in the terms of their own interpretive schemata. As we assign particular meanings to the statements and ideas we encounter, we construct our identities through our interactions with discourse. Thus, interactive reconstructions refer to the internal thought processes through which we interpret and reinterpret discursive statements in the light of our own social worlds. It is through this process that situated audiences construct the situated meanings that constitute particular identities and subjective selves from collectively available discursive materials. It is where macro-level discourse interacts with micro-level consciousness. Thus, through the analysis of discourse, we shed light upon the interactive construction of meaning and subjective formation of identity.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc277"></a>D<span class="s1">ISCOURSE</span> <span class="s1">AND</span> C<span class="s1">ULTURE</span></p>
<p class="p6">This understanding of discourse is closely aligned with the concept of culture. If discourse represents a field of interconnected ideas from which individuals draw and construct meaning, culture represents those constructed meanings. Thus, culture is also a product of discourse. Whereas individuals construct their identities by assigning meaning to discourse; groups of individuals construct their culture by collectively assigning a shared meaning to discourse. Culture, then, is the collective form of identity; it is the product of the collective construction of meaning. The study of discourse is thus also the study of cultural relationships, “those webs of meaning and perception in which all parties are entangled” (Ferrell 1999:398).</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc278"></a>What is Discourse Analysis?</i></p>
<p class="p6">The first questions to answer in terms of an analysis of discourse are practical in nature: What does one analyze? What counts as discourse? Where does one find it? Nicholas Green referred to discourse as a "pattern of statements across a range of archives and sites" (1990:3). Most relevant to the current context is Green's formulation of the location of discourse, in particular its <i>range</i>, the <i>eclectic plurality of locations</i> in which discourse presents itself. As discourse denotes patterns of interconnected ideas, it also denotes a certain amount of <i>intertextuality</i> among these ideas. The concept of intertextuality signifies the ways in which the meaning of one discursive statement depends on the meaning of another to which it refers, either explicitly or implicitly. A statement’s meaning, rather than being inherent to the language itself, shifts according to whether or not one has knowledge of its reference point. Given these two characteristics of discourse, its <i>ubiquity</i> and <i>intertextuality</i>, its analysis calls for the collection of a mélange of disparate sources of study.</p>
<p class="p9">As one can hardly follow Foucault's prescription to "read everything, study everything" (quoted in Andersen 2003:13), the next question must be in regard to the selection criteria of this mélange of disparate sources to be analyzed. Instead of starting by setting up concrete parameters around explicitly operationalized units of analysis, placing them in brackets that firmly separate that which is to be studied from that which is to be ignored, discourse demands a more fluid approach to data collection. What can be firmly established at the onset of analysis is source material that will serve as the research design's <i>starting points.</i></p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc279"></a>T<span class="s1">HE</span> E<span class="s1">MERGENCE</span> <span class="s1">OF</span> D<span class="s1">ATA</span></p>
<p class="p6">Sites of source material are chosen as starting points of discursive analysis based on the perceived likelihood that they will "provide theoretically relevant results" (Phillips and Hardy 2002:66). It is from these initial analyses, as one chases discursive meanings down their referential rabbit-holes, other sites and sources emerge as meaningful avenues of analysis. Discourse thus calls for a methodology of <i>emergence</i> (Phillips and Hardy 2002:75), in which sources of data, unconstrained by genre, type or technology (Rose 2007:149), are allowed to emerge as relevant throughout the course of analysis. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Within the analysis, what are the criteria through which information emerges as relevant? In answering this question, we see that <i>what</i> one studies emerges from <i>how</i> one studies the phenomenon in question at the starting point of analysis. Whereas relatively little attention is given to the selection of the "more obvious starting points for a discourse analysis" (Rose 2007:148) within the literature, the widening of one's gaze from initial starting points is given ample attention. This is because the process though which disparate sources emerge as relevant is the driving force of discourse analysis itself: the construction of meaningful relationships between and across statements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">To provide a more concrete conceptualization of this process: an emergent method calls for deep engagement with the initial source material under study and, through a form of conceptual coding, the identification of key themes within the material. Crucial again in this context is the situated construction of meaning. As words and images are assigned specific meanings in specific statements, the task of the analyst is to identify meaningful clusters of association (Anderson 2003:11-12), patterns of constructed meaning that coalesce into discursive formations.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc280"></a>D<span class="s1">EFINING</span> R<span class="s1">ELATIONS</span> <span class="s1">BETWEEN</span> S<span class="s1">TATEMENTS</span></p>
<p class="p6">In analyzing these key themes and the meaningful connections between and among them, an emergent method demands the question: Where else do such discursive formations exist? What is the relationship between statements across disparate sources? As Foucault states, one should analyze:</p>
<p class="p7">[R]elations between statements (even if the author is unaware of them; even if the statements do not have the same author; even if the authors were unaware of each other’s existence); relations between groups of statements thus established (even if these groups do not concern the same, or even adjacent fields; even if they do not possess the same formal level; even if they are not the focus of assignable exchanges); relations between statements and groups of statements and events of quite different kind (technical, economic, political, social). (1972:29)</p>
<p class="p7">Thus, a particular discourse has the ability to manifest through dissimilar authors, from divergent fields, and at varying levels of formality. As discursively connected statements exist across a wide and eclectic range of technical, economic, political and social sources, their connections can and should be analyzed no matter how sizeable the social chasm between them appears.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">There are two additional key points in Foucault’s formulation, the first of which relates to intentionality. The establishment of a meaningful connection across statements from disparate sources does not presuppose any form of direct contact between the two. It does not suppose that a specific statement of one author influenced the second author to express a similar statement, but rather that each author is tapping into the same field of meaning, i.e., the same discourse. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">The second crucial point in Foucault’s formulation relates to meaningful connections not only between statements but also <i>events</i>. Here it is important to distinguish between the power of discourse and the power of discursive statements. Just as it is not supposed that one discursive statement is the cause of another, it is not supposed that discursive statements in themselves cause individual actions or events. Even in the specific case of an individual hearing or reading a discursive statement and immediately acting out its logic, her or his action is still an expression of an idea. It is an action or event structured by discourse just as the statement before it. Each is an expression of the discourse it represents. The power lies in the idea, from which statements, actions and events manifest. A statement is only as powerful as the meaning assigned to it.</p>

<p class="p6">Due to the importance of the <i>productive power</i> of discourse, the literature provides a number of important questions focused on the organizational properties of discourse and their relation to the production of meaning: What is the particular knowledge a discourse produces? How is it structured to do so? (Rose 2007) Of what is it attempting to persuade? Does it contain internal contradictions that allow for interpretive flexibility? (Tonkiss 1998) What are they underlying, unspoken assumptions on which it is based? What does it implicitly define as true, real or natural? (Jones 1989) Jonathan Potter (1996) provides additional questions to guide discursive analysis: Where does a discourse construct the locus of blame for a particular problem? How does it construct the tenets of responsibility and accountability? How does it categorize individuals, groups or events? These are the questions that guide my analysis of the rhetorical organization and productive power of American discourse since September 11, 2001.</p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc226"></a>Social Problem Frame</i></p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc286"></a>D<span class="s1">IAGNOSTIC</span> F<span class="s1">RAMEWORK</span></p>
<p class="p6">The diagnostic framing of a social problem refers to the particular definition of the situation put forth by the claims-maker: What is positioned as problematic? How is the problem defined? Loseke outlines three main criteria to be fulfilled in order for a situation to be diagnosed as a social problem. The first is that it is constructed as physically or morally harmful. The second is that it negatively affects a substantial number of people, and the third is that it both can and should be changed. These framing criteria relate to the question of the particular knowledges produced by discourse: How are America and the Global War on Terror, both literally and symbolically, defined?</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc287"></a>M<span class="s1">OTIVATIONAL</span> F<span class="s1">RAMEWORK</span></p>
<p class="p6">The motivational framing of a social problem refers to the ways in which claims-makers attempt to convince audiences of the rightness of their cause. These tactics of persuasion include appeals to emotion as well as appeals to logic. Appeals to emotion include constructions of victims as sympathetically innocent and villains and essentialized evil. The 'logic' to which claims-makers appeal is culturally and historically situated; it refers to "audience members' understanding of <i>cultural themes</i>, which are beliefs about how the world should work" (Loseke 2003:63; emphasis in original). These motivational tactics relate to questions of a problem's locus of blame, its possible consequences, and the ways in which discourse categorizes and describes related individuals, group and events: Why did 9/11 happen? What motivated the event? Who is to blame? What is the cost of inaction or defeat in the Global War on Terror?</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc288"></a>P<span class="s1">ROGNOSTIC</span> F<span class="s1">RAMEWORK</span></p>
<p class="p6">The prognostic framing of a social problem refers to the construction of a proposal of response: How are we to fix that which is defined as problematic? Diagnostic and motivational frameworks are built for the prognostic framework to stand upon. It defines the actual course of action from which to proceed. Essential to the current analysis, it also defines who is responsible for fixing the putative problem. This framework thus relates to questions of responsibility and accountability: What is America's role in world affairs? What would victory in the Global War on Terror accomplish? How would victory be measured?</p>
<p class="p7">This first section of the overall project, the starting point of discursive analysis, will frame and interact with the sections to follow. The formation of interconnected ideas expressed within US Presidential discourse will serve as a signifier of American discourse at the macro-level. Collectively, these ideas represent an image of the nation that is collectively accessible to its citizens and can thus be drawn upon to construct meaning and direct action. After I construct a working definition of the substance of this macro-level iteration of American discourse in the first section, I will then move on to examine an instance of its productive power in the second section.</p>
<p class="p5"><b><a id="doc230"></a>Data</b></p>
<p class="p5"><i><a id="doc231"></a>Collection</i></p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc284"></a>L<span class="s1">OCATING</span> A<span class="s1">MERICAN</span> D<span class="s1">ISCOURSE</span></p>
<p class="p6">One of the defining characteristics of discursive statements is that they are used in the service of persuasion (Rose 2007:161). Thus, American discourse can be found in what might be its highest concentration in sources of US political discourse. Whereas the overlap between American discourse and US political discourse is vast, I analytically separate the two, with US political discourse including statements and ideas that refer to the more specific political machinations of the daily grind of Capitol Hill and American discourse as a reference to the more collectively held ideas of the US and its role in world affairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">A similar distinction can be made in regard to the Global War on Terror discourse, which includes more tactical knowledges of warfare or ideas from other nations in the “coalition of the willing” that are not necessarily expressions of American discourse thus defined. Many of the larger ideas of American discourse, though, are intimately tied in with the Global War on Terror discourse. It is the discourse at this intersection (e.g., when assumed superiority is equated with a responsibility to propagate the US model of democracy) that is most important in the current analysis. As these intersecting discourses can be found in an eclectic plurality of locations, a starting point of analysis must be established.</p>
<p class="p7">My effort to locate a theoretically relevant starting point leads me to a particular site of US political discourse: the Presidential pulpit. As both the representative of the executive branch of US government and commander-in-chief of US Armed Forces, the US President is the key contributor to the ongoing constructions of both US political discourse and Global War on Terror discourse. As the figurehead of the nation, discursive statements made by the President are not only in the service of persuasion, their appeal is meant to be broad and thus tap into the more collectively held notions that constitute American discourse. Thus, the starting points of my analysis are found in US Presidential speeches since September 11, 2001.</p>
<p class="p5"><a id="doc285"></a>S<span class="s1">ELECTION</span> <span class="s1">OF</span> S<span class="s1">PEECHES</span></p>
<p class="p6">Given that the two US Presidents gave over 150 speeches directly related to the Global War on Terror (Bush gave at least 135; Obama has given at least 25), speeches will be selected based on their perceived relevance for the topic under study. This selection process will be guided by the timing of the speech, the focus of the speech, and the size and importance of the stage from which the speech was given. These decisions will be aided by the titles given to the speeches by official sources such as the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, the National Archives, or the White House Official website or unofficial sources such as the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, or the online database of PresidentialRhetoric.com. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">In regard to timing, speeches will be selected if they were given on the anniversary or actual date of a major event within the war (e.g., speeches given on September 11th or March 19th, the anniversary of the invasion of Iraq). In regard to focus, speeches will be selected if their primary subject has been identified as the creation of legislation related to the war (e.g., Homeland Security Act; the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act) or the historical meaning of the war (e.g., "The Meaning of the War"; "Historical Analogies for the War on Terror"). The speeches that historically have reached the largest audiences (e.g., State of the Union Addresses; Inaugural Addresses) will be selected as well.</p>
<p class="p7">As stated at the onset of this prospectus, the gaze of my analysis is focused on distinct research questions in each of the four sections of the overall research project. The specific shape each set of research questions takes is structured in turn by the questions that guide analysis previously outlined (Jones 1989; Potter 1996; Rose 2007; Tonkiss 1998). The organization of these questions and the presentation of their results is further guided by a constructionist approach to the analysis of social problems, specifically the framework outlined by Donileen Loseke (2003) and Joel Best (Loseke and Best 2003).</p>
<p class="p7">The analysis begins by examining the speeches made by US President George W. Bush on and directly after September 11, 2001. I examine these speeches as the beginnings of the construction of terrorism as a social problem and President Bush as a "claims-maker" attempting to convince audiences of the rightness of his cause (Loseke 2003: 25). The social constructionist perspective will further structure the organization of this section of analysis in that I will examine the speeches in terms of (1) diagnostic framing, (2) motivational framing and (3) prognostic framing.</p>
