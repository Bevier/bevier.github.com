<h2 id="ep1-pushit">EP #1 - pushit</h2>

<hr />

<h4 id="yacht-ringthebell">1. YACHT - Ring the Bell</h4>

<p><em>See Mystery Lights (2009)</em> </p>

<p><em>Why not start out with some good old-fashioned blasphemy? If we&#8217;re going to fuck with some authority, might as well shoot for the heavens.</em></p>

<h4 id="jenslekman-kanskerjagkridig">2. Jens Lekman - Kanske Är Jag Kär I Dig</h4>

<p><em>Night Falls Over Kortedala (2007)</em> </p>

<p><em>So many little things I love about this song: the nice little riff in the opening, the brass and bass in the closing, &#8220;the best way to touch your heart is to make an ass of myself,&#8221; etc.</em></p>

<h4 id="thebetaband-shestheone">3. The Beta Band - She&#8217;s the One</h4>

<p><em>The Three E.P.&#8217;s (1998)</em></p>

<p><em>Oh yeah, the theme! It was truly blasphemous of me not to have owned this album. I have High Fidelity to thank for pushing me toward Milan Kundera and Gabriel García Márquez (though I never got around to Cash by Johnny Cash) as well as &#8220;Dry the Rain,&#8221; but somehow I only recently listened to the rest of The Three E.P.&#8217;s, literally the band&#8217;s first three EPs bundled together for US release. Fitting together on one CD with a minute to spare, it became greater than the sum of its parts. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going for here, folks. And what would Rob Gordon advise? We&#8217;re supposed to kick it up for track 2, then ease it back down for track 3, right? Well fuck that. Let&#8217;s push it in the other direction.</em></p>

<h4 id="thestooges-nofun:saltnpepa-pushit">4. The Stooges - No Fun: Salt &#8217;n Pepa - Push It</h4>

<p><em>2 Many DJs: As Heard on Radio Soulwax, Pt. 2 (2002)</em></p>

<p><em>The collaboration we&#8217;ve all been waiting for.</em> </p>

<h4 id="arcadefire-normalperson">5. Arcade Fire - Normal Person</h4>

<p><em>Reflektor (2013)</em></p>

<p><em>Hearing that the leader of LCD Soundsystem was producing the latest Arcade Fire album was unbelievable to me. It was like someone telling me that Paul McCartney was going to produce a new Led Zeppelin record. &#8220;What? Are you serious? Are they even allowed to do that?&#8221; No surprise, I&#8217;m a huge fan.</em></p>

<h2 id="ep2-refrain">EP #2 - refrain</h2>

<h4 id="xtc-deargod">1. XTC - Dear God</h4>

<p><em>Dear God (1987)</em></p>

<p><em>It was only this year that I stumbled across XTC and their slew of excellent 80s albums, but I&#8217;ve known this song half my life. When I was a freshman in high school, I got a CD burner. It was a big deal. That winter, Uncle Rob and his massive CD case came to visit. I did nothing but copy CDs for the two weeks he was there. I remember there being a lot of metal, and I got into all of that for a while. But over all that noise, the things I remember most vividly were the first times I listened to (1) &#8220;Little Earthquakes&#8221; by Tori Amos and (2) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrueVp_kuZ8">&#8220;Dear God&#8221; by&#8230;Sarah McLachlan</a>? I thought you had to have lots of guitars and double bass drums and male anatomy parts to fuck with authority. I just remember thinking, &#8220;What else am I completely wrong about?&#8221;</em></p>

<h4 id="hozier-takemetochurch">2. Hozier - Take Me to Church</h4>

<p><em>Take Me to Church EP (2013)</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYSVMgRr6pw"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/MYSVMgRr6pw/0.jpg" alt="Hozier - Take Me to Church Video" /></a> </p>

<p><em>I don&#8217;t know a whole lot about this fella, but I do know that if someone sends you this heart-wrenching video, you shouldn&#8217;t just roll out of bed and watch it, because someone might knock on your door (like the cable guy), and you&#8217;ll find yourself saying something like, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m okay. Everything&#8217;s fine. I just watched a very emotional music video on my iphone.&#8221;</em></p>

<h4 id="ema-3jane">3. EMA - 3Jane</h4>

<p><em>The Future&#8217;s Void (2014)</em></p>

<p><em>After the intensely good songwriting of her first work, Erika M. Anderson has been criticized for her second effort&#8217;s clunky and awkward lyrical style, which is full of internet jargon and simple declaratives about the perils of social media. But her cliché indictments are surrounded by such emotion that I believe her. Also, I&#8217;d say being famous enough to have people video you walking down the street and post it on the internet is pretty fucking awkward.</em></p>

<h4 id="thevelvetunderground-ohsweetnuthin">4. The Velvet Underground - Oh! Sweet Nuthin&#8217;</h4>

<p><em>Loaded (1970)</em></p>

<p><em>Say a word for Lou Reed (1942&#8211;2013), may he rest in peace.</em></p>

<h4 id="ema-satellites">5. EMA - Satellites</h4>

<p><em>The Future&#8217;s Void (2014)</em></p>

<p><em>Back to Erika, and why I believe her. My favorite part of this album&#8211;when that bass hits, the strings come in and she belts &#8220;I remember when the world was divided by a concrete wall and a curtain of iron&#8221;&#8211;is such a simple and profound statement. It&#8217;s nothing new. Everyone knows that. But still, most listening to this album don&#8217;t remember that (hell, I don&#8217;t actually remember that), and it&#8217;s easy for the facebook generation to forget that the ease with which we instantly communicate and present ourselves to a public audience is unprecedented. Maybe she&#8217;s not saying anything new because nobody remembers what&#8217;s already been said.</em></p>

<h2 id="ep3-theheavystuff">EP #3 - the heavy stuff</h2>

<h4 id="theholdsteady-hornetshornets">1. The Hold Steady - Hornets! Hornets!</h4>

<p><em>Separation Sunday (2005)</em></p>

<p><em>This last E.P. is a race to the finish. And these guys have one thing right: the heavy stuff ain&#8217;t at its heaviest.</em></p>

<h4 id="pixies-u-mass">2. Pixies - U-Mass</h4>

<p><em>Trompe le Monde (1991)</em></p>

<p><em>Because if you&#8217;re only going to scream two words, why not &#8220;It&#8217;s Educational&#8221;?</em></p>

<h4 id="dinosaurjr.-freakscene">3. Dinosaur Jr. - Freak Scene</h4>

<p><em>Bug (1987)</em></p>

<h4 id="vicgodardandthesubwaysect-parallellines">4. Vic Godard and the Subway Sect - Parallel Lines</h4>

<p><em>We Oppose All Rock &amp; Roll (1978)</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;We wanted to change the reasons for playing rock music&#8230;we wanted it to be a medium for ideas rather than a release from boredom.&#8221;</em><br/>
<em>- Vic Godard</em></p>

<h4 id="x-rayspex-ohbondageupyours">5. X-Ray Spex - Oh Bondage! Up Yours!</h4>

<p><em>Oh Bondage! Up Yours! / I Am a Cliche (1978)</em></p>

<p><em>At least 3 surprises in the first 30 seconds&#8230; You&#8217;ll see.</em></p>

<h4 id="cloudnothings-stayuseless">6. Cloud Nothings - Stay Useless</h4>

<p><em>Attack on Memory (2012)</em></p>

<p><em>Just your average freshman saxophone major who makes myspace profiles for fictitious bands where he plays all the instruments and then one gets discovered and he has to find real people for the band&#8217;s first gig and decide whether to even show up for mid-terms. He didn&#8217;t. Cloud Nothings = no longer fictitious.</em></p>

<h4 id="television-marqueemoon">7. Television - Marquee Moon</h4>

<p><em>Marquee Moon (1977)</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;&#8216;Marquee Moon&#8217; is one of the rare things in life where too much turns out to be just enough.&#8221;</em><br/>
