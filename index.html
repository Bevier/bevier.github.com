<p>&#8220;Know that the problems of social science, when adequately formulated, must include both [personal] troubles and [public] issues, both biography and history, and the range of their intricate relations. Within that range the life of the individual and the making of societies occur; and within that range the sociological imagination has its chance to make a difference in the quality of human life in our time.&#8221;<br/>
- C. Wright Mills</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8220;It is at this point a political action to tell it like it is, to say what I really believe about my life instead of what I&#8217;ve always been told to say.&#8221;</strong><br/>
<em>- Carol Hanisch</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="para1">In 1968, Carol Hanisch penned a staff memo that would later become the feminist essay, &#8220;The Personal is Political.&#8221;
Hanisch was working as an organizer for the Southern Conference Educational Fund. Her memo was written in response to another SCEF staff member who contended that consciousness-raising&#8211;or discussing the ways in which structures of oppression manifest themselves in daily life&#8211;was merely &#8216;personal therapy&#8217; for the oppressed rather than a truly &#8216;political&#8217; activity.</p>

<p id="para1">These divergent opinions about the proper direction of one organization were representative of a much larger schism in the Women&#8217;s Liberation Movement, centered around the relative utility of coming together to discuss individual experiences of oppression. </p>

<p id="para1">To critics, such groups did not appear to be taking any explicit action in the public arena, and were therefore &#8216;not political.&#8217; Those taking part in said meetings, however, found it much more difficult to mark a clear distinction between the personal and political spheres of their lives. Hanisch explains: </p>

<blockquote><p id="para1">So the reason I participate in these meetings is not to solve any personal problem. One of the first things we discover in these groups is that personal problems are political problems. </p>
</blockquote>

<p id="para1">In this context, &#8216;political&#8217; refers broadly to issues of power. And that is what consciousness-raising helps us understand: the dynamics of power structures at work in our personal lives. </p>

<p id="para1">The importance of exploring this interplay between the personal and the political is also seen in the work of sociologist C. Wright Mills and his concept of &#8216;the sociological imagination.&#8217; </p>

<blockquote>
<p id="para1">&#8220;The sociological imagination enables us to grasp history and biography and the relations between the two within society. That is its task and its promise.&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>

<p id="para1">Mills makes a distinction between &#8220;the personal troubles of milieu&#8221; and &#8220;the public issues of social structure.&#8221; Using one&#8217;s sociological imagination implies working to understand the complex dynamics between the two. </p>

<blockquote>
<p id="para1">&#8220;Know that many personal troubles cannot be solved merely as troubles, but must be understood in terms of public issues&#8211;and in terms of the problems of history-making. Know that the human meaning of public issues must be revealed by relating them to personal troubles&#8211;and to the problems of individual life.&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>

<p id="para1">This brings us to our current purposes. This webspace, first and foremost, exists to exercise my sociological imagination. As I traverse through academia, I inevitably encounter personal problems with structural implications, decisions that are influenced less by my field of study than by the political-economic system in which it is embedded. These decisions (e.g., what types of research to conduct, how to collect data, where to publish, whether or not use required textbooks, which web and software tools to utilize, where to host a website, etc.) reflect the ever-present tension between personal values and market forces. The first purpose this space serves is to explore that tension. </p>

<p id="para1">The second function of this space is to host my research, writing, and various academic resources. In my years as a graduate student I have spent countless hours scouring the internet trying to figure out how to install this or that software package and, in general, trying to increase the efficiency of my workflow. Since &#8220;spend hours scouring the internet&#8221; is not a part of any productive workflow, I will be sharing the fruits of my efforts (e.g., abandoning Microsoft Word for the world of raw text, learning Markdown, coding with R, working in RStudio, switching to linux, working from the command line, understanding github, writing a dissertation on your iPad, etc.) in the hope that others can make use of them. More than anything, I am compelled to critically analyze and educate. I love learning new things, and I love sharing them with others. The second purpose this space serves, then, is to educate. If you&#8217;re interested, come back and see me. I&#8217;ll be here.</p>
